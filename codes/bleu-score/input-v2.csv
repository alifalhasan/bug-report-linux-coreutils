1982273,,"To reproduce this bug, you would need a system with Fedora 34 installed and then perform the following steps:

1. Upgrade the system using `dnf update` to ensure all packages are up-to-date.
2. Specifically upgrade coreutils and related packages to version 8.32-30.fc34.x86_64 if they are not already at this version, although this step might be covered by a general `dnf update`.
3. Verify the system is running kernel version 5.12.14-300.fc34.x86_64.
4. Attempt to log in as root or use `su` or `scp` to connect as root and verify that commands like `uname`, `cat`, etc., are not found.

Given these steps, a simplified test case could involve:

```bash
# Ensure the system is updated
sudo dnf update

# Check kernel version
uname -r

# Attempt to reproduce the error by logging in as root or using su/scp
su -

# Inside the su session or after logging in as root
uname
cat --version
```

This sequence checks for the presence of the issue without directly attempting to install conflicting packages, which is not straightforward due to the package manager's conflict resolution mechanisms. The critical part here is observing whether basic commands like `uname` and `cat` are recognized after switching to the root user or logging in as root via a method that might trigger the bug (e.g., `su`, `scp`).",,
1960792,"rpmbuild -bb coreutils.spec 
rpmbuild --rebuild coreutils-8.32-24.fc34.src.rpm","Based on the provided log output, it appears that the bug is related to the `ls` command's behavior when displaying colored output and performing stat system calls.

The relevant commands to reproduce the bug are:

1. `mkdir d`
2. `strace -q -o log1 ls --color=always d` (or equivalent using `strace` or another system call tracing tool)
3. `mkdir d/subdir`
4. `touch d/regf`
5. `ln d/regf d/hlink`
6. `ln -s regf d/slink`
7. `ln -s nowhere d/dangle`
8. `strace -q -o log2 ls --color=always d` (or equivalent using `strace` or another system call tracing tool)

The test case seems to be checking if the number of stat system calls performed by `ls` when displaying colored output remains constant, even when additional files and directories are added to the directory being listed. The bug is triggered because the second run of `ls` performs one more stat system call than the first run.

To reproduce the bug, you can use the following test case:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a directory and subdirectory
mkdir d
mkdir d/subdir

# Create regular files and symlinks
touch d/regf
ln d/regf d/hlink
ln -s regf d/slink
ln -s nowhere d/dangle

# Run ls with colored output and strace to log system calls
strace -q -o log1 ls --color=always d
n_stat1=$(grep -vF +++ log1 | wc -l)

# Add more files or directories (not needed in this case)
# ...

# Run ls again with colored output and strace to log system calls
strace -q -o log2 ls --color=always d
n_stat2=$(grep -vF +++ log2 | wc -l)

# Check if the number of stat system calls has increased
if [ $n_stat1 -ne $n_stat2 ]; then
    echo ""FAIL: Number of stat system calls has changed""
    exit 1
else
    echo ""PASS: Number of stat system calls remains constant""
    exit 0
fi
```

This test case creates the necessary files and directories, runs `ls` with colored output and strace to log system calls, and checks if the number of stat system calls has increased. If the number of stat system calls has changed, it indicates a failure and exits with a non-zero status code.","To reproduce the bug described in the given output, you need to follow a series of steps that involve setting up and running specific tests for the `ls` command within the context of the Coreutils package version 8.32.

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. **Clone or download the Coreutils source code:**
   Ensure you have access to the Coreutils 8.32 source code.
   ```sh
   git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/coreutils.git
   cd coreutils
   git checkout v8.32
   ```

2. **Build the Coreutils package:**
   You need to configure and build the package so that you have access to the test suite.
   ```sh
   ./bootstrap
   ./configure
   make
   ```

3. **Run the specific test case:**
   The failing test is `tests/ls/stat-free-color.sh`. Navigate to this directory and run it.

   ```sh
   cd tests/ls/
   ../gt-stat-free-color.sh  # or directly: sh stat-free-color.sh
   ```

### Explanation of Test Case:

The `stat-free-color.sh` script checks if the `ls` command can display colored output without making unnecessary system calls (`stat`, `lstat`, etc.). The failing condition is detected when the number of system calls made during different runs (with and without subdirectories) does not match as expected.

#### Key Observations from Logs:
- **log1** (without subdirectory):
  ```sh
  statx(AT_FDCWD, ""d"", AT_STATX_SYNC_AS_STAT, STATX_MODE, {stx_mask=STATX_BASIC_STATS|STATX_MNT_ID, stx_attributes=0, stx_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, stx_size=40, ...}) = 0
  ```

- **log2** (with subdirectory):
  ```sh
  statx(AT_FDCWD, ""d"", AT_STATX_SYNC_AS_STAT, STATX_MODE, {stx_mask=STATX_BASIC_STATS|STATX_MNT_ID, stx_attributes=0, stx_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, stx_size=140, ...}) = 0
  ```

Notice the difference in `stx_size` (directory size) which leads to an unexpected number of system calls.

### Expected Outcome:
The test should pass if the number of `stat`, `lstat`, etc., calls made by the `ls` command is consistent across different directory structures, as expected by the script logic. The failing condition suggests that there may be a discrepancy in how the file system metadata is being handled or cached.

### Debugging Steps:
1. **Check Coreutils Build and Configuration:**
   Ensure your build environment matches the conditions under which this bug was observed.
   
2. **Inspect `ls` Behavior:**
   Use tools like `strace` to inspect the exact system calls made by `ls` in both scenarios.

3. **Review Patch or Changesets:**
   Check for any recent patches or changes that might have affected the behavior of `ls` regarding file metadata handling and caching.

By following these steps, you should be able to reproduce and debug this specific issue related to `ls` performance and system call consistency when displaying colored output with various directory structures.","To reproduce the bug described in the logs, you would need to run a specific test case from the `coreutils` package's testing suite. Specifically, the issue seems to be related to the `ls` command and its behavior with color output when it doesn't have access to the terminal (or when coloring is explicitly disabled).

Here are the steps required to reproduce the bug:

1. **Install coreutils sources:**
   First, you need to download or clone the source code of `coreutils`. If you're using a Linux distribution that supports package management, you might be able to get the source from there. Otherwise, you can clone it directly from the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/coreutils.git
   cd coreutils
   ```

2. **Prepare the build environment:**
   Follow the standard procedure for building a package from source. You may need to install additional dependencies if they are not already installed on your system.

   ```bash
   ./bootstrap # generate configure script and other files
   ./configure # prepare the build system
   make        # compile the package
   ```

3. **Run the specific test case:**
   The problematic test is `tests/ls/stat-free-color.sh`. Navigate to the tests directory and run this particular test.

   ```bash
   cd tests
   env NO_COLOR=t ./stat-free-color.sh
   ```

   Note that `env NO_COLOR=t` ensures that color output is disabled, which seems to be relevant based on the logs. If you want to replicate the exact environment where it failed (e.g., with a terminal), you can omit this part.

4. **Check the test result:**
   The test should output the results and possibly fail if there's an issue with `ls` behavior in color-free mode. The failure will provide similar logs as those shown in your bug description.

By following these steps, you should be able to reproduce the bug with the `ls` command when used without terminal coloring. If you encounter any issues during the process (like missing dependencies), make sure all required tools and libraries are installed on your system before proceeding with the build and test execution."

1. **Recreate the directory structure**: Create a directory hierarchy similar to `/mailacct/imapbox/Maildir//.Archives.2018/cur/` with multiple files having names similar to `1549609568.M246447P12677.xxx.my-system.de,S=658661,W=667579:2,Sa`.
2. **Run du command**: Run the `du` command on the recreated directory structure and verify if it stops counting files at a certain point, similar to what is described in the bug description.
3. **Verify file permissions and ownership**: Use `ls -la` to check the file permissions and ownership of the files in the directory, as seen in the provided output.
4. **Run stat command**: Run the `stat` command on individual files, especially the ones that seem to be causing issues, to verify if there are any irregularities in their metadata.
5. **Check for hidden files or special characters**: Use `ls -la` and `find` commands to check for any hidden files or special characters in the directory names or file names that might be causing issues with the `du` command.
6. **Test with different file sizes and names**: Create files of varying sizes and names within the recreated directory structure to see if the issue is specific to certain file sizes or naming conventions.

Some example commands to test:

* `du -sh /mailacct/imapbox/Maildir//.Archives.2018/cur/`
* `ls -la /mailacct/imapbox/Maildir//.Archives.2018/cur/* | grep -B2 ""1549609568.M246447P12677.xxx.my-system.de,S=658661,W=667579:2,Sa""`
* `stat /mailacct/imapbox/Maildir//.Archives.2018/cur/1549609568.M246447P12677.xxx.my-system.de,S=658661,W=667579:2,Sa`
* `find /mailacct/imapbox/Maildir//.Archives.2018/cur/ -type f -print0 | xargs -0 stat`

By running these test cases and commands, you may be able to reproduce the issue and gain a better understanding of what is causing the problem with the `du` command.","Based on the provided information, you're observing that a specific utility or application is not processing certain files in a directory as expected, while `ls` and `du` handle them correctly. To diagnose this issue more thoroughly, we need to identify what command or process is stopping at a particular file.

Here are some steps and commands to help reproduce the bug:

### 1. Identify the Command Causing the Issue
Firstly, you need to understand which specific command or application is not processing files beyond `1549609568.M246447P12677.xxx.my-system.de,S=658661,W=667579:2,Sa`.

If the utility in question is a script, try to run it with verbose logging enabled if possible.

### 2. Use `find` and `stat`
Use `find` to recursively find files and then use `stat` or another tool to gather information about each file.

```sh
# Find all files in .Archives.2018/cur
find /mailacct/imapbox/Maildir/.Archives.2018/cur -type f

# Gather stats on these files
find /mailacct/imapbox/Maildir/.Archives.2018/cur -type f -exec stat {} \;
```

### 3. Use a Script to Simulate the Process
If you can identify that it’s a script or specific command, create a test script to simulate its behavior.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

cd /mailacct/imapbox/Maildir/.Archives.2018/cur || exit 1

for file in *; do
    stat ""$file""
done
```

Run this script and observe if it stops at the same point as the original issue.

### 4. Check for Special Characters or Hidden Files
Sometimes, special characters or hidden files can cause issues.

```sh
# List all files including hidden ones
ls -la /mailacct/imapbox/Maildir/.Archives.2018/cur

# Look for any unusual characters in file names
find /mailacct/imapbox/Maildir/.Archives.2018/cur -type f | grep -v '^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]'
```

### 5. Verify File Permissions and Ownership
Ensure that the files have consistent permissions and ownership.

```sh
# List detailed information about all files
ls -l /mailacct/imapbox/Maildir/.Archives.2018/cur

# Check specific file metadata
stat /mailacct/imapbox/Maildir/.Archives.2018/cur/1549609568.M246447P12677.xxx.my-system.de,S=658661,W=667579:2,Sa
```

### 6. Check for Filesystem Issues (Even if `fsck` is planned)
To rule out any filesystem corruption, you can also try using tools like `dumpe2fs`, `debugfs`, or `lsblk`.

```sh
# Show filesystem metadata
sudo dumpe2fs -h /dev/sdX

# Check for errors (replace /dev/sdX with the appropriate device)
sudo fsck /dev/sdX
```

### 7. Analyze Logs if Available
Check any logs generated by the application or script that might be failing to see if there are any error messages.

```sh
grep -i ""error"" /path/to/logfile
```

By following these steps, you should be able to gather more information about why the processing stops at a specific point and reproduce the issue.","To effectively reproduce this issue in a controlled environment, you'll need to simulate similar conditions that led to the problem on your production server. Here are several steps and commands that can help you replicate and investigate the issue:

### 1. Prepare the Environment

- **Create Test Directory**: Make a directory structure similar to the one on the production server.
  
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/test/Maildir/.Archives.2018/cur/
```

- **Simulate Large Number of Files**: Create files with names and sizes similar to those in your problematic directory.

```bash
for i in {1..200}; do
  dd if=/dev/urandom of=""/tmp/test/Maildir/.Archives.2018/cur/file$i"" bs=512 count=$((i * 10))
done

# To match your file naming pattern:
for i in {447..600}; do
  dd if=/dev/urandom of=""/tmp/test/Maildir/.Archives.2018/cur/1549609568.M$iP12677.xxx.my-system.de,S=$((i*10)),W=$((i*15)):2,Sa"" bs=512 count=$i
done
```

### 2. Execute Commands

- **Run `stat` and `ls`**: Verify that these commands work correctly on the test directory.

```bash
cd /tmp/test/Maildir/.Archives.2018/cur/
stat *
ls -l
du -sh .
```

- **Simulate Bug Conditions**: Use your application or script to scan the files as if it were doing so on the production server.
  
If you have a script that was running on the production server, try running it against your test directory.

### 3. Verify and Compare

- **Compare Outputs**: Make sure all commands work as expected in your test environment.

```bash
# Check if ls can list all files:
ls -l | wc -l

# Check file sizes using du:
du -sh .
```

- **Run `strace` for Debugging**: Use `strace` to debug and trace the system calls made by your application or script.

```bash
strace -f ./your_script.sh > strace_output.log 2>&1
```

### 4. Analyze Logs

If you have logs from the production environment, compare them with the output of `strace`.

- **Search for Errors**: Look for errors in the `strace` output or logs.

```bash
grep -i error strace_output.log
```

### 5. Test Edge Cases

- **Large Directories**: Ensure that directories with a large number of files are handled correctly.
  
- **Special Characters in Filenames**: Check if special characters can cause issues.
  
```bash
touch ""file_with_special_chars_!@#$%^&*(){}[].txt""
ls -l file_with_special_chars*
```

### 6. Test File System Limits

- **Check Directory Size and Limitations**: Verify file system limits, inode usage, etc.

```bash
df -i /tmp/test/
du -sh /tmp/test/Maildir/.Archives.2018/cur/
```

### 7. Consider System Resources

- **Memory Usage**: Check if the script runs out of memory.
  
```bash
free -h
top
```

By following these steps, you should be able to create a controlled environment that mimics your production server and identify what might be causing the issue with `stat` or file parsing. This can help in debugging and finding a solution."

","```bash
strace -Tttfvs 4096 df -l
```
This command is used after performing the setup described in steps 1-7 of the ""Steps to Reproduce"" section. The exact sequence of setup and commands to reproduce the bug involves:

1. Setting up an NFS server with exports.
2. Creating an autofs map file (`/etc/autofs.direct`) that maps to these NFS shares.
3. Including this map in `/etc/auto.master`.
4. Restarting autofs and verifying the autofs mounts are present in `/proc/self/mounts`.
5. Mounting one of the autofs mountpoints (e.g., by changing directory into it).
6. Exiting the mountpoint.
7. Stopping the NFS service on the server to induce the hanging behavior when `df -l` is run.

However, since these steps are part of the setup and not directly related to the command that reproduces the bug, they are not included in the final answer. The key command that demonstrates the bug (hanging on `stat()` call for autofs mounts) after setup is completed is `strace -Tttfvs 4096 df -l`.","```

2. Create several file systems (e.g., /dev/sdb1, /dev/sda1, /dev/sdc1) and mount them at different points (e.g., /, /boot, /tmp).
3. Configure bind mounts as described in the fstab snippet:
   - Mount a device (e.g., /dev/sdc1) at /Volumes/dune.
   - Create bind mounts from /Volumes/dune subdirectories to other locations on the system (e.g., /usr/local/sftp-homes/flow/cms, /home/builduser, /tmp, /var/tmp).

The steps provided in the bug report are descriptions of how to set up a scenario and what happens, but they do not directly state a command that would be used to test for the bug specifically as requested. The scenario setup is:
1. `touch testfile`

rpmbuild --rebuild coreutils-8.32-24.fc34.src.rpm","Based on the provided log output, it appears that the bug is related to the `ls` command's behavior when displaying colored output and performing stat system calls.

The relevant commands to reproduce the bug are:

1. `mkdir d`
2. `strace -q -o log1 ls --color=always d` (or equivalent using `strace` or another system call tracing tool)
3. `mkdir d/subdir`
4. `touch d/regf`
5. `ln d/regf d/hlink`
6. `ln -s regf d/slink`
7. `ln -s nowhere d/dangle`
8. `strace -q -o log2 ls --color=always d` (or equivalent using `strace` or another system call tracing tool)

The test case seems to be checking if the number of stat system calls performed by `ls` when displaying colored output remains constant, even when additional files and directories are added to the directory being listed. The bug is triggered because the second run of `ls` performs one more stat system call than the first run.

To reproduce the bug, you can use the following test case:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a directory and subdirectory
mkdir d
mkdir d/subdir

# Create regular files and symlinks
touch d/regf
ln d/regf d/hlink
ln -s regf d/slink
ln -s nowhere d/dangle

# Run ls with colored output and strace to log system calls
strace -q -o log1 ls --color=always d
n_stat1=$(grep -vF +++ log1 | wc -l)

# Add more files or directories (not needed in this case)
# ...

# Run ls again with colored output and strace to log system calls
strace -q -o log2 ls --color=always d
n_stat2=$(grep -vF +++ log2 | wc -l)

# Check if the number of stat system calls has increased
if [ $n_stat1 -ne $n_stat2 ]; then
    echo ""FAIL: Number of stat system calls has changed""
    exit 1
else
    echo ""PASS: Number of stat system calls remains constant""
    exit 0
fi
```

This test case creates the necessary files and directories, runs `ls` with colored output and strace to log system calls, and checks if the number of stat system calls has increased. If the number of stat system calls has changed, it indicates a failure and exits with a non-zero status code.","To reproduce the bug described in the given output, you need to follow a series of steps that involve setting up and running specific tests for the `ls` command within the context of the Coreutils package version 8.32.

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. **Clone or download the Coreutils source code:**
   Ensure you have access to the Coreutils 8.32 source code.
   ```sh
   git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/coreutils.git
   cd coreutils
   git checkout v8.32
   ```

2. **Build the Coreutils package:**
   You need to configure and build the package so that you have access to the test suite.
   ```sh
   ./bootstrap
   ./configure
   make
   ```

3. **Run the specific test case:**
   The failing test is `tests/ls/stat-free-color.sh`. Navigate to this directory and run it.

   ```sh
   cd tests/ls/
   ../gt-stat-free-color.sh  # or directly: sh stat-free-color.sh
   ```

### Explanation of Test Case:

The `stat-free-color.sh` script checks if the `ls` command can display colored output without making unnecessary system calls (`stat`, `lstat`, etc.). The failing condition is detected when the number of system calls made during different runs (with and without subdirectories) does not match as expected.

#### Key Observations from Logs:
- **log1** (without subdirectory):
  ```sh
  statx(AT_FDCWD, ""d"", AT_STATX_SYNC_AS_STAT, STATX_MODE, {stx_mask=STATX_BASIC_STATS|STATX_MNT_ID, stx_attributes=0, stx_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, stx_size=40, ...}) = 0
  ```

- **log2** (with subdirectory):
  ```sh
  statx(AT_FDCWD, ""d"", AT_STATX_SYNC_AS_STAT, STATX_MODE, {stx_mask=STATX_BASIC_STATS|STATX_MNT_ID, stx_attributes=0, stx_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, stx_size=140, ...}) = 0
  ```

Notice the difference in `stx_size` (directory size) which leads to an unexpected number of system calls.

### Expected Outcome:
The test should pass if the number of `stat`, `lstat`, etc., calls made by the `ls` command is consistent across different directory structures, as expected by the script logic. The failing condition suggests that there may be a discrepancy in how the file system metadata is being handled or cached.

### Debugging Steps:
1. **Check Coreutils Build and Configuration:**
   Ensure your build environment matches the conditions under which this bug was observed.
   
2. **Inspect `ls` Behavior:**
   Use tools like `strace` to inspect the exact system calls made by `ls` in both scenarios.

3. **Review Patch or Changesets:**
   Check for any recent patches or changes that might have affected the behavior of `ls` regarding file metadata handling and caching.

By following these steps, you should be able to reproduce and debug this specific issue related to `ls` performance and system call consistency when displaying colored output with various directory structures.","To reproduce the bug described in the logs, you would need to run a specific test case from the `coreutils` package's testing suite. Specifically, the issue seems to be related to the `ls` command and its behavior with color output when it doesn't have access to the terminal (or when coloring is explicitly disabled).

Here are the steps required to reproduce the bug:

1. **Install coreutils sources:**
   First, you need to download or clone the source code of `coreutils`. If you're using a Linux distribution that supports package management, you might be able to get the source from there. Otherwise, you can clone it directly from the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/coreutils.git
   cd coreutils
   ```

2. **Prepare the build environment:**
   Follow the standard procedure for building a package from source. You may need to install additional dependencies if they are not already installed on your system.

   ```bash
   ./bootstrap # generate configure script and other files
   ./configure # prepare the build system
   make        # compile the package
   ```

3. **Run the specific test case:**
   The problematic test is `tests/ls/stat-free-color.sh`. Navigate to the tests directory and run this particular test.

   ```bash
   cd tests
   env NO_COLOR=t ./stat-free-color.sh
   ```

   Note that `env NO_COLOR=t` ensures that color output is disabled, which seems to be relevant based on the logs. If you want to replicate the exact environment where it failed (e.g., with a terminal), you can omit this part.

4. **Check the test result:**
   The test should output the results and possibly fail if there's an issue with `ls` behavior in color-free mode. The failure will provide similar logs as those shown in your bug description.

By following these steps, you should be able to reproduce the bug with the `ls` command when used without terminal coloring. If you encounter any issues during the process (like missing dependencies), make sure all required tools and libraries are installed on your system before proceeding with the build and test execution."

strace -Tttfvs 4096 df -l
```
This command is used after performing the setup described in steps 1-7 of the ""Steps to Reproduce"" section. The exact sequence of setup and commands to reproduce the bug involves:

1. Setting up an NFS server with exports.
2. Creating an autofs map file (`/etc/autofs.direct`) that maps to these NFS shares.
3. Including this map in `/etc/auto.master`.
4. Restarting autofs and verifying the autofs mounts are present in `/proc/self/mounts`.
5. Mounting one of the autofs mountpoints (e.g., by changing directory into it).
6. Exiting the mountpoint.
7. Stopping the NFS service on the server to induce the hanging behavior when `df -l` is run.

However, since these steps are part of the setup and not directly related to the command that reproduces the bug, they are not included in the final answer. The key command that demonstrates the bug (hanging on `stat()` call for autofs mounts) after setup is completed is `strace -Tttfvs 4096 df -l`.","```

1. Set up a Linux system (e.g., Fedora 19) with coreutils-8.21-12.fc19.x86_64.
2. Create several file systems (e.g., /dev/sdb1, /dev/sda1, /dev/sdc1) and mount them at different points (e.g., /, /boot, /tmp).
3. Configure bind mounts as described in the fstab snippet:
   - Mount a device (e.g., /dev/sdc1) at /Volumes/dune.
   - Create bind mounts from /Volumes/dune subdirectories to other locations on the system (e.g., /usr/local/sftp-homes/flow/cms, /home/builduser, /tmp, /var/tmp).
4. Run the command: `/usr/bin/df -hT --exclude-type=tmpfs --exclude-type=devtmpfs`

This setup and command should potentially reproduce the bug where ""df"" shows a random bind mount instead of the actual mount point for certain file systems.",,/usr/bin/df -hT --exclude-type=tmpfs --exclude-type=devtmpfs

The details include environment variables, memory maps, and log messages indicating that a core dump was saved for the `/bin/sleep` command on multiple occasions.

Given this context, it seems like the issue might be related to how the `sleep` command is executing or being terminated, possibly due to a signal or an unexpected condition. Here are some steps and commands that could potentially reproduce the bug:

1. **Run the Sleep Command**: The most straightforward approach is to run the `/bin/sleep` command with various parameters to see if it crashes or produces a core dump.
   ```
   /bin/sleep 10
   ```

2. **Check for Signal Handling**: Sometimes, processes crash due to how they handle signals. You can try sending different signals to the `sleep` process to observe its behavior.
   ```
   /bin/sleep 100 &
   kill -SIGINT $!
   kill -SIGSEGV $!
   ```

3. **Use GDB for Debugging**: Running the `sleep` command under a debugger like GDB might provide insights into what's going wrong.
   ```
   gdb --args /bin/sleep 10
   run
   ```

4. **Valgrind for Memory Issues**: If the issue is related to memory management, running the command with Valgrind could help identify problems.
   ```
   valgrind /bin/sleep 10
   ```

5. **Strace for System Calls**: To see if the problem lies in how system calls are being made or handled, you can use `strace`.
   ```
   strace /bin/sleep 10
   ```

6. **Reproduce with Different Parameters and Environment**: Try modifying environment variables that might affect the behavior of the `sleep` command, such as `LC_ALL`, `LANG`, etc., to see if the issue is locale or environment-dependent.
   ```
   LC_ALL=C /bin/sleep 10
   ```

7. **Check for File System Issues**: Ensure that the file system where `/bin/sleep` resides and where it might write temporary files (if any) is not full, corrupted, or has permissions issues.

8. **System Call Tracing with syscall**: If available, tracing syscalls can provide detailed insights into what the process was doing when it crashed.
   ```
   syscall_trace -c /bin/sleep 10
   ```

Remember, without more specific details about the expected behavior versus the actual behavior (e.g., error messages, exact conditions under which the bug occurs), these suggestions are speculative. The goal is to stress the `sleep` command in various ways to see if any of these methods can reproduce the core dump or crash condition described in the log messages.","To identify and potentially reproduce a bug based on the information provided in the log messages and environment details, we need to analyze the logs for clues about what caused the crashes. The logs show that `abrt` (Automatic Bug Reporting Tool) saved core dumps of the `/bin/sleep` command. This indicates that there might be some issue with how `/bin/sleep` is being run or a system-level problem causing it to crash.

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue

1. **Run Basic Sleep Command:**
   Start by running the `sleep` command in a controlled environment and observe if any crashes occur.
   ```sh
   sleep 5
   ```
   Check for core dumps using:
   ```sh
   abrt-cli list
   ```

2. **Check System Logs:**
   Look at `/var/log/messages` or similar system log files to see if there are any relevant messages around the time the crashes occurred.

3. **Inspect Environment Variables:**
   Ensure no unusual environment variables are set that might be causing issues with `sleep`. For example:
   ```sh
   env | grep SLEEP
   ```

4. **Run in Different Contexts:**
   Try running the sleep command under different conditions, such as within a script or background process.
   ```sh
   nohup sleep 5 &
   ```
   
   Or,
   ```sh
   (sleep 10; echo ""done"") &
   ```

5. **Check for Memory Corruption:**
   Use tools like `valgrind` to check if there's any memory corruption or issues that might cause the crash.
   ```sh
   valgrind /bin/sleep 5
   ```

6. **Verify System Dependencies:**
   Ensure all system libraries are up-to-date and properly installed, as a corrupted library could potentially cause crashes.
   ```sh
   ldd $(which sleep)
   ```
   
7. **Check for Kernel Issues:**
   Sometimes kernel issues can cause seemingly unrelated applications to crash. Check the dmesg output:
   ```sh
   dmesg | grep -i ""sleep""
   ```

8. **Reproduce with Specific Arguments:**
   The logs don't mention any specific arguments, but try running `sleep` with different arguments and see if that affects behavior.
   ```sh
   sleep 10 &
   sleep 30 &
   ```

### Test Cases

- Run `sleep` in the foreground and background to ensure it behaves consistently:
  ```sh
  sleep 5       # Foreground
  nohup sleep 10 &   # Background
  (sleep 20; echo ""done"") &    # Subshell Background
  ```

- Monitor system resources while running `sleep`:
  ```sh
  top | grep -i ""sleep""
  ```

### Summary

The steps above should help you systematically reproduce and diagnose the issue with `/bin/sleep`. By testing under different conditions, monitoring system resources, and using tools like `valgrind`, you can gather more information about what might be causing the crashes.","The provided information suggests that `/bin/sleep` is crashing and core dumps are being generated by ABRT (Automatic Bug Reporting Tool) on your system.

To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:

### 1. Set Up Environment

Make sure you have `abrt` installed on the system:
```sh
sudo yum install abrt  # On CentOS/RHEL
sudo apt-get install abrt  # On Ubuntu/Debian
```

Enable and start the ABRT service if it is not already running:
```sh
sudo systemctl enable abrtd
sudo systemctl start abrtd
```

### 2. Run Sleep Command

Try running the `sleep` command in a loop to simulate high usage, which might increase the likelihood of reproducing the issue:
```sh
while true; do /bin/sleep 10 & done
```
Or run it with various parameters (this is more likely if certain sleep values are problematic):
```sh
for i in {1..3600}; do /bin/sleep $i & done
```

### 3. Monitor ABRT

Monitor the ABRT logs to see if any core dumps are generated:
```sh
sudo journalctl -u abrtd -f
# or look at the specific log file for ABRT coredumps
tail -f /var/log/messages | grep abrt
```

### 4. Analyze Core Dumps

Once a core dump is generated, use `abrt-cli` to investigate:
```sh
sudo abrt-cli list
sudo abrt-cli info <problem_id>
# Optionally, analyze the coredump with gdb
gdb /bin/sleep /var/spool/abrt/ccpp-<timestamp>.new/coredump
```

### 5. Additional Checks

Check for any kernel panic messages or other system logs that could indicate an underlying hardware or software issue:
```sh
dmesg | grep -i error
tail -f /var/log/messages
```

By performing these steps, you should be able to reproduce the bug and gather more information about what is causing the `sleep` command to crash. If you can reliably reproduce this issue, consider reporting it to the appropriate maintainers with detailed logs and system specifications."

2307847,"The added systemd-devel buildrequires in the latest coreutils package results in the `who` command sourcing its information about active logins from systemd rather than `utmp`.  That's not bad, but this new code path doesn't have support for listing sessions that:
 - aren't seats,
 - don't have an associated terminal device, and
 - aren't listed as ""XDG_SESSION_TYPE=tty"".

Cockpit doesn't have a XDG seat, doesn't allocate a pseudoterminal, and sets its XDG_SESSION_TYPE to ""web"" which means that it gets excluded.

The upstream code in question is part of read_utmp_from_systemd() in gnulib: http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gnulib.git;a=blob;f=lib/readutmp.c;h=10d79d1d81a5eeb9da7cbfcc72f214430abcfa2c;hb=HEAD#l800 (look at the heuristics under the ""Try harder"" comment for why this works properly with ssh sessions, even without controlling terminals).

This is a regression in the test suite of Cockpit and definitely a usability regression which will be visible to Fedora users.  We're currently tracking this as a knownissue in our CI: https://github.com/cockpit-project/bots/issues/6789.  I've also filed the bug upstream, but after waiting a while I haven't noticed it appear on the archives page yet (nor have I received a rejection email for it).  When it does appear I'll update our issue with a link to it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install cockpit, login to a session
2. run `who`

Actual Results:  
The 'web console' session is not listed in the output of who.

Expected Results:  
The session should be listed in `who` (as it was with coreutils-9.5-7).","1. Install cockpit.
2. Login to a Cockpit session via web console.
3. Run the following command:

```sh

The new DIR_COLORS* files now say COLOR is recognized but ignored.  The old config files mentioned COLOR=none shuts colorization off, which is what I've always used in the past, and ""COLOR=none"" still properly seems to work currently.

Is this being changed or is this still the correct way to disable colorization for ""ls""?  If this is still the correct way, the DIR_COLOR* config files should say to set ""COLOR=none"" to disable colorization instead of the confusing text now that says it's ""recognized"" but ""ignored"".

If this is changing, then maybe a helpful note in the config file to say where/what the proper way to disable colorization is.  Thanks.

Because of this I have been blocking updates to coreutils in Rawhide and Fedora 39. and I'm running coreutils-9.2-4.fc39.x86_64.

This change in the -v option has been reverted in 9.4 (released 2023-08-29).  From [1]:

** Changes in behavior

  'cp -v' and 'mv -v' will no longer output a message for each file skipped
  due to -i, or -u.  Instead they only output this information with --debug.
  I.e., 'cp -u -v' etc. will have the same verbosity as before
  coreutils-9.3.

Understanding it would be risky pushing 9.4 into Fedora 39 at this late stage, would it be possible to backport just the patch that fixes this issue?

I am going to propose this as a freeze exception for the 39 beta.

2203350,"On Fedora 38 and later, running `uname -p` says ""unknown"". On Fedora 37 - at least Fedora 37 original release images, haven't checked an updated system yet - `uname -p` gives the arch, at least on my system and VMs running on that system it does (x86_64).

This is an issue because Python `platform.processor()` basically just returns the output of `uname -p`, or an empty string if it's ""unknown"". I have a script that relies on that output to figure out what arch it's running on, which was broken because of this - I had to implement a fallback to `platform.machine()` if the output of `platform.processor()` is empty.

This package was selected as one of the most crucial, which when missing, will burn distro down.
Please take care, and adapt  your package to exclude java on i686. For your convenience, there was added macro %{java_arches}, including all arches java is available on,  which you can use to ifarch-out java specific features out in i686 (on non-java arches). Although for plain java package, the change is as simple as https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/maven/c/520942645bfd1e4721dacd536a6ccbf80495a8ae?branch=rawhide, you can not use it. The ExclusiveArch: %{java_arches} is not going to work for you, because your package is not simple java application, and also non-java world depends on it (even if you are one of dozen noarchs in this set)

Suppose ones want lower case abbreviated day-of-week names. By default %a produces capitalized names, eg Fri.  Using %^a correctly produces upper case. Using %#a unfortunately produces the same as %^A, ie. FRI. Quite clearly FRI is not the opposite case of Fri.  Instead of an 'opposite case' modifier (which seems to be quite useless because the case of the normal output is already definitively known) there should be a pure lower case modifier.

Additional info:
In above I have chosen a / modifier for lower case (only because it almost looks like a lower case 'l', and doesn't need any shell escape).  Also, 
a proper lower case modifier obsoletes the %P (which should never have been implemented that way - modifiers are for modifying, alpha characters are for unique formats - but that is an error in strftime(3) which coreutils/date imitates).

Yet again, it looks like I am the only person left on the planet who uses 'date' and bothers to file a bug report.  If this report meets with the usual 'you should file upstream' or 'not a bug' then this will be the last bug report I ever file ... and then I will join the other happy people who never waste their valuable time filing bug reports.","```

FAIL tests/ls/stat-free-color.sh (exit status: 1)","To reproduce the bug described in the logs, you would need to run a specific test case from the `coreutils` package's testing suite. Specifically, the issue seems to be related to the `ls` command and its behavior with color output when it doesn't have access to the terminal (or when coloring is explicitly disabled).

Here are the steps required to reproduce the bug:

1. **Install coreutils sources:**
   First, you need to download or clone the source code of `coreutils`. If you're using a Linux distribution that supports package management, you might be able to get the source from there. Otherwise, you can clone it directly from the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/coreutils.git
   cd coreutils
   ```

2. **Prepare the build environment:**
   Follow the standard procedure for building a package from source. You may need to install additional dependencies if they are not already installed on your system.

   ```bash
   ./bootstrap # generate configure script and other files
   ./configure # prepare the build system
   make        # compile the package
   ```

3. **Run the specific test case:**
   The problematic test is `tests/ls/stat-free-color.sh`. Navigate to the tests directory and run this particular test.

   ```bash
   cd tests
   env NO_COLOR=t ./stat-free-color.sh
   ```

   Note that `env NO_COLOR=t` ensures that color output is disabled, which seems to be relevant based on the logs. If you want to replicate the exact environment where it failed (e.g., with a terminal), you can omit this part.

4. **Check the test result:**
   The test should output the results and possibly fail if there's an issue with `ls` behavior in color-free mode. The failure will provide similar logs as those shown in your bug description.

By following these steps, you should be able to reproduce the bug with the `ls` command when used without terminal coloring. If you encounter any issues during the process (like missing dependencies), make sure all required tools and libraries are installed on your system before proceeding with the build and test execution."

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

Steps to Reproduce:

2. Open Terminal and use stat command for file or directory.
3. In Terminal there is no entry for ""Birth"" (btime).


Actual results:
Birth time (btime) has no entry.


Expected results:
Fedora 33 (GNOME) uses Btrfs as the file system by default. Btrfs supports birth time (btime) for files and directories, so there must also be a birth time (btime) entry per stat command.


Additional info:

The cause could be in Fedora 33 installer. That is, when users install Fedora 33 (GNOME) to the internal disk by default, a too small Btrfs filesystem is used, so the inodes size is too small.

When one starts a job remotely using nohup and normally logs out
(ctrl-D) the job stays running. However, if you do not logout and
let ssh time out the job is killed.

The situation is more interesting on a multi-processor machine when
running an openmp job. In this case it seems to kill all but one
of the threads and the job keeps running on a single cpu.

The colours used by ls don't follow those defined in the Terminal palette settings. As a result, they sometimes have legibility issues due to low contrast. They are also inconsistent with the colors used throughout the desktop.

This, as I understand it, is because ls is using the 256 color palette, rather than the terminal-provided 16 color palette.

The gnome-terminal developers have actually been working on improving the legibility of the 16 color palette, but these improvements are being ignored by ls.

1739747,"Description of problem: the date command returns an error unexpectedly for a valid date


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): coreutils-8.31-2.fc30


How reproducible: My system is set to UTC+8 and is in Singapore. In 1981, there was a change in TZ for Singapore and Malaysia which went from UTC+7.5 to UTC+8. It happened at at 2330 1981-12-31 which became 0000 1982-01-01. I was there when that happened so I know of that. I was testing the date -d command and noticed that it was returning an error. Perhaps I am not checking it correctly and I am not sure, therefore, if this is indeed a bug in the TZ caclculations.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On a system set to UTC+8 Singapore, run date -d 1981-12-31. It will succeed.
2. Then run 1982-01-01 and it will fail.
3. Running 1928-01-02 succeeds. 

Actual results:
date -d 1982-01-01 returns date: invalid date ‘1982-01-01’

Expected results:
Fri Jan  1 00:00:00 +08 1982

1764152,"Description of problem:
Using docker in centos7/rhel7 and trying to run image that only uses base Fedora 30 image and updates coreutils, fails with `Operation not permitted` on coreutils executables (like `ls` or `stat`).

Note: I am not sure if this is Fedora coreutils problem or rhel docker problem. If it belongs somewhere else, I'll gladly move it to rhel.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
On the system: `docker-1.13.1-103.git7f2769b.el7.centos.x86_64`
In the container: `coreutils-8.31-5.fc30.x86_64`


How reproducible:
Prepare simple docker image on CentOs7, run as simple command as `ls /`.
The same is also reproducible on RHEL 7 machine (same version of Docker).


Steps to Reproduce:
1.
$ cat Dockerfile 
FROM fedora:30
RUN dnf -y update coreutils
2. sudo docker build
3. sudo docker run -it --rm <build image> ls /

Actual results:
ls: cannot access '/': Operation not permitted


Expected results:
Just list all in `/`


Additional info:
Interestingly enough, `ls` without any arguments works just fine. `ls /` and `ls .` do not, even though that `ls` == `ls /` == `ls .` `ls -l` has some weird output.

When a link references non-existent file or directory, the `ls -l` shows the link target with red background and white flashing text in it. The flashing text has some issues:
a) it's quite distracting and even if I fix the link the terminal still shows it
   flashing few lines above - I do not want to clear the terminal content,
   because I need to see other text in there
b) when the target link is long and you cannot copy it with mouse you need to
   re-type it, thus read it. The flashing makes this quite depressing, when the
   text is there, is not there, is there, is not there, is there,....
c) I've been told, long time ago, that changing icons which try to warn about
   something should not do that ad infinity, it's enough to flash like 10 times
   and then stop flashing - that time it was for power consumption reasons; this
   flashing text may (or may not) be a similar case
d) it's enough to have the white text on a red background to have it highlighted
   as an error, there's really no need for the awful flashing.

This flashing reminded me about all the advertising banners on the web sites, which also change their content (thus flash) all the time, which is very distracting when one wants to read the text of the page.

Could you make it not flash, please?",None
1444774,"coreutils >= 8.25 (Fedora 24) has a nasty arbitrary heap write issue that I presume can be exploited to run arbitrary code as the user running date,
just by setting a large TZ variable in the command line or in the environment.

Would it be possible to assign an CVE if required, as I'm not familiar with that process.

1688740,"The coreutils-6.10-manpages.patch screws up the formatting of the man page (and the note it adds to the --help output is not proper English anyway).

The rendered man page looks like:

       -t, --text
              read in text mode (default)

              Note: There is no difference between binary and text mode option

              and disable file name escaping


Note that the -z option is not a new item, but continues on from the note, and there's a spurious line break after ""not newline,"". In the troff source the problem is a missing .TP macro and a missing newline, but the man page appears to be generated by help2man so it's not as simple as fixing the troff.

Please either drop the patch completely (it seems unnecessary to me) or fix the formatting and the grammar.

I've attached a patch for the patch, which moves the ""Note:"" to the end, so it doesn't mess up the formatting of the --text and --zero options. I also fixed the grammar.","man command_name

Replace `command_name` with the specific command whose man page is affected by the patch, such as `cat`, `cp`, etc., depending on which command's man page was modified in the patch.

""stat"" did not see any irregularity at one of those files.

As it happens on a production server, we will check the filesystem tonight, but as ls can and du can't parse it correctly,
it won't be the fs .","To effectively reproduce this issue in a controlled environment, you'll need to simulate similar conditions that led to the problem on your production server. Here are several steps and commands that can help you replicate and investigate the issue:

### 1. Prepare the Environment

- **Create Test Directory**: Make a directory structure similar to the one on the production server.
  
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/test/Maildir/.Archives.2018/cur/
```

- **Simulate Large Number of Files**: Create files with names and sizes similar to those in your problematic directory.

```bash
for i in {1..200}; do
  dd if=/dev/urandom of=""/tmp/test/Maildir/.Archives.2018/cur/file$i"" bs=512 count=$((i * 10))
done

# To match your file naming pattern:
for i in {447..600}; do
  dd if=/dev/urandom of=""/tmp/test/Maildir/.Archives.2018/cur/1549609568.M$iP12677.xxx.my-system.de,S=$((i*10)),W=$((i*15)):2,Sa"" bs=512 count=$i
done
```

### 2. Execute Commands

- **Run `stat` and `ls`**: Verify that these commands work correctly on the test directory.

```bash
cd /tmp/test/Maildir/.Archives.2018/cur/
stat *
ls -l
du -sh .
```

- **Simulate Bug Conditions**: Use your application or script to scan the files as if it were doing so on the production server.
  
If you have a script that was running on the production server, try running it against your test directory.

### 3. Verify and Compare

- **Compare Outputs**: Make sure all commands work as expected in your test environment.

```bash
# Check if ls can list all files:
ls -l | wc -l

# Check file sizes using du:
du -sh .
```

- **Run `strace` for Debugging**: Use `strace` to debug and trace the system calls made by your application or script.

```bash
strace -f ./your_script.sh > strace_output.log 2>&1
```

### 4. Analyze Logs

If you have logs from the production environment, compare them with the output of `strace`.

- **Search for Errors**: Look for errors in the `strace` output or logs.

```bash
grep -i error strace_output.log
```

### 5. Test Edge Cases

- **Large Directories**: Ensure that directories with a large number of files are handled correctly.
  
- **Special Characters in Filenames**: Check if special characters can cause issues.
  
```bash
touch ""file_with_special_chars_!@#$%^&*(){}[].txt""
ls -l file_with_special_chars*
```

### 6. Test File System Limits

- **Check Directory Size and Limitations**: Verify file system limits, inode usage, etc.

```bash
df -i /tmp/test/
du -sh /tmp/test/Maildir/.Archives.2018/cur/
```

### 7. Consider System Resources

- **Memory Usage**: Check if the script runs out of memory.
  
```bash
free -h
top
```

By following these steps, you should be able to create a controlled environment that mimics your production server and identify what might be causing the issue with `stat` or file parsing. This can help in debugging and finding a solution."
1511951,"Description of problem:
This bug symptomps are identical to those in BZ#1309247, which provided unsatisfactory fix.

The autofs detection is based on '-hosts' string in /proc/self/mounts, however the name of the map can differ greatly.

For example, my auto.direct map results in the following mounts entries (sample):
/etc/auto.direct on /mnt/test/test012 type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=19,pgrp=7520,timeout=300,minproto=5,maxproto=5,direct,pipe_ino=111441)
/etc/auto.direct on /mnt/test/test037 type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=19,pgrp=7520,timeout=300,minproto=5,maxproto=5,direct,pipe_ino=111441)
/etc/auto.direct on /mnt/test/test006 type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=19,pgrp=7520,timeout=300,minproto=5,maxproto=5,direct,pipe_ino=111441)
/etc/auto.direct on /mnt/test/test054 type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=19,pgrp=7520,timeout=300,minproto=5,maxproto=5,direct,pipe_ino=111441)

Should one of those autofs mounts be mounted, the stat() systemcall on the ""type autofs"" entry would hang until timeout expires:

sample output of strace -Ttt of ""df -l"":
13:45:54.668017 stat(""/mnt/test/test012"", 0x7ffc1ff1c480) = -1 EIO (Input/output error) <180.238070>

Upstream version of coreutils-8.28 fixes the issue by skipping dummy_fs for df -l, which prevents calling stat() on the autofs mount entries.

Upstream commits I have found:
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=coreutils.git;a=commit;h=a19ff5d8179a7de38109fc78278229fd96f3941a

http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gnulib.git;a=commit;h=2768ceb7994506e2cfba88be3b6bd13ef5440a90

This has an impact on test ""tests/df/skip-rootfs.sh"", which FAILs because rootfs cannot be seen using ""df -t rootfs -a"" and additionally, the man page of df needs to be modified as dummy filesystems are not visible anymore.

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an NFS server, test directories and export them (/etc/exports):

    /srv/exports/test001 192.168.122.0/24(ro,root_squash)
    /srv/exports/test002 192.168.122.0/24(ro,root_squash)
    /srv/exports/test003 192.168.122.0/24(ro,root_squash)
    /srv/exports/test004 192.168.122.0/24(ro,root_squash)

2. Create autofs map file ""/etc/autofs.direct"" with direct maps to nfs shares:

    /mnt/test/test001 -ro,root_squash,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192 192.168.122.1:/srv/exports/test001
    /mnt/test/test002 -ro,root_squash,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192 192.168.122.1:/srv/exports/test002
    /mnt/test/test003 -ro,root_squash,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192 192.168.122.1:/srv/exports/test003
    /mnt/test/test004 -ro,root_squash,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192 192.168.122.1:/srv/exports/test004

3. Include the ""/etc/autofs.direct"" in ""/etc/auto.master"":

    /- /etc/auto.direct

4. Restart autofs and check for the following entries in /proc/self/mounts:

    /etc/auto.direct on /mnt/test/test001 type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=19,pgrp=7520,timeout=300,minproto=5,maxproto=5,direct,pipe_ino=111441)
    /etc/auto.direct on /mnt/test/test002 type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=19,pgrp=7520,timeout=300,minproto=5,maxproto=5,direct,pipe_ino=111441)
    /etc/auto.direct on /mnt/test/test003 type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=19,pgrp=7520,timeout=300,minproto=5,maxproto=5,direct,pipe_ino=111441)
    /etc/auto.direct on /mnt/test/test004 type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=19,pgrp=7520,timeout=300,minproto=5,maxproto=5,direct,pipe_ino=111441)

5. Mount the autofs mountpoint by e.g. # cd /mnt/test/test004 and verify the fs is mounted (/proc/self/mounts):
    192.168.122.1:/srv/exports/test012 on /mnt/test/test012 type nfs4 (... options trimmed ...)

6. Exit the mountpoint to home directory: # cd
7. Stop the NFS service on the NFS server (# systemctl nfs stop).
8. Perform strace -Tttfvs 4096 df -l
 

Actual results:
The df -l command will hang on the stat() call for /mnt/test/test004.

Expected results:
The df -l command does not perform stat() calls on autofs (or dummy) filesystems.

Interestingly, the inverse problem also occurs -- The built-in handles the ',' radix input, but the coreutils version does not.

IMO, both radix options should evaluate properly for both the built-in and the coreutils versions of printf.

26G	    /mnt/rootn

[root@hoho8-chidig-com user1]# du -h /mnt/homen | tail -1
57G	    /mnt/homen

for the rootn partition, the 26G copied size is consistent with the source size.

For the homen partition, the 57G is consistent with the source size.

However, the count given by the dd copies don't match:

 In the case of the root->rootn copy it is 54G instead of 27G
 in the case of the home->homen copy it is 942G instead of 57G

1577872,"Description of problem:

TLDR: It would be nice if upstream made a new release of coreutils 8.30 which fixes some bugs but while it is not available it would be nice to backport some upstream patches.

Long description:

Some issues related with the changes in date formats have been recently fixed upstream:

1. https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=19856 Bad month translation printed with date command in Greek locale

Actually caused by https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10871 (lack of support of multiple grammar cases for month names) and affects more languages than just Greek. This is fixed, new glibc is distributed by Fedora. What is missing is the lack of support of the new format specifiers: %OB, %Ob, and %Oh in date command line utility. Currently only %B, %b, %h are supported which is usually correct but custom formats should be supported for those who need them.

Fixed by the commit: http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/commit/?id=b1fa4aa (later overridden by http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/commit/?id=ad9b283 and http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/commit/?id=3299901)

2. https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=30814 Increase the value of MAX_MON_WIDTH in ls.c

As a consequence of the changes in dates the date column in ""ls -l"" is too narrow to fit the month name in several languages, for example in Catalan. Now March and May are both displayed as ""de ma""; June and July both displayed as ""de ju"".


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 8.29


How reproducible: always (""ls -l"" issue depending on locale)


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a text console (Terminal, xterm, konsole, text mode)
2. Execute the command:

LC_ALL=ca_ES.utf8 ls -l

3. Execute the command:

date ""+%OB""


Actual results:

If the current directory contains files last updated in March, May, June or July (any year) then ""ls -l"" in Catalan displays the month name as ""de ma"" which is ambiguous. The same problem may also appear in other languages.

The date command displays:

%OB


Expected results:

ls -l should have enough space to display the full abbreviated month name: ""de març"", ""de maig"", ""de juny"", ""de jul."" (yes, if the name of a month is short it is not abbreviated).

date should display the name of the current month, in all languages. If a language needs multiple grammar forms of a month name then the form appropriate when displaying a month standalone should be used (this usually means a nominative case)

1. Accuracy

Actual results: In terminal, outputs resulting from the execution of command:
– 'df -h' are specified at best with one digit accuracy.

Enhancement: An accuracy with two digits (model 0.00 M) would be appropriate.

2. Documentation

Actual results: Df tool displays sizes associated to data storage observing the notation (k, M, G, ...) while obviously outputs resulting from 'df' tends to indicate that actually, by default sizes associated to data storage are specified by observing the international standard ISO 80000 –also known as IEC 80000– which sets the convention regarding binary prefixes (e.g. 1024 = 1 Ki = '1 kibi') in that field. But that is all a deduction.

'man df' lacks valuable information related to that policy that required to be established in man page.

Enhancement: above mentioned policy to be dully documented.

3. Conventions

Actual results: Convention used regarding the signs '%' and Metric prefixes (k, M, G, ...)  attached along with data storage values –made upon format (model 0%)– is the one that applies to American English and British English and others countries attached to the British crown. Nevertheless others countries' convention regarding values an units representation observe a format which introduces a space between values and units (here as model: 0 %).

Furthermore readability of expressions displayed in such formats are not equal; model '0 %' is superior to '0%'.

Enhancement: As expected model '0 %' is the one who fill higher purpose.

4. Basic units of measure are missing (by policy, not as result of an issue)

Actual results: Basic units of measure are missing since only metric prefixes are displayed.

Enhancement: Since unit prefixes illustrated here are in this context likely to indicate nothing else but multiples of the unit proper to digital information, characters 'b' or 'B' and their equivalents for others supported system languages must be considered to be part of the designation.

Additional info: Metric prefix is a unit prefix that precedes a basic unit of measure to indicate in that case a multiple of the unit.",None

Additional info:

I posted this as a question on comp.unix.shell on 6/30/08, """"Gnu ls bug?"",
and had the bug confirmed on other Linux systems as well.

Stephane Chazelas (a smart guy) added this:
<quote>
Could be a Linux bug. With -i alone, ls gets the inode number
from readdir, which if you have --color, ls does a lstat to get
the type of file (directory, regular...) and gets the result
from there.

So with -i alone, you get the inode of the dir entry in the
parent filesystem while with other options that trigger the call
of lstat(2), you get the inode of the mount point.
</quote>

Also, Geoff Clare (another smart guy) wrote:
<quote>
Yes, this is a known bug in some implementations of readdir(),
although I didn't think any modern systems suffered from it.

It is mentioned in the rationale for readdir() in the new POSIX
revision:

    When returning a directory entry for the root of a mounted file
    system, some historical implementations of readdir() returned the
    file serial number of the underlying mount point, rather than of
    the root of the mounted file system. This behavior is considered
    to be a bug, since the underlying file serial number has no
    significance to applications.
</quote>

So, this is a bug that manifests with ls, but might be a bug in the kernel
system call or glibc, I don't know which.

I marked this bug as ""urgent"" since reporting incorrect inode numbers can break
backups, and reporting underlying ""hidden"" inode numbers represents a security risk.","/bin/ls -i /

Sometimes when rebooting the date command returns an invalid time.  The invalid
time appears to be the time of the previous reboot.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
coreutils-8.27-20.fc27.x86_64

How reproducible:
Fairly.  However, this does not happen every time.

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  In a personal crontab for root, specify a line like:
@reboot        nice run-parts /root/cron.reboot
2.  In the /root/cron.reboot directory, specify a member which includes the following:
set -x
cd /root
date ""+%X""
[some command that takes a few seconds, maybe just a ""sleep 5""]
date ""+%X""
...
3.  reboot
4.  review mail from reboot cron job

Actual results:
Sometimes my cron job mail output looks like:

> Date: Fri, 6 Apr 2018 10:09:36 -0400
> From: ""(Cron Daemon)"" <root@gecko1.bugbane-hollow>
> To: root@gecko1.bugbane-hollow
> Subject: Cron <root@gecko1> nice run-parts /root/cron.reboot

> ++ cd /root
> ++ date +%X
> 06:09:20 AM
> ++ /root/bin/wait_boinc_up.awk
> ++ date +%X
> 10:09:36 AM
> ...

Note the time of the cron job, 10:09:36.
However, the output of the first date command is 06:09:20 AM, hours before the
reboot cron job ran - more or less the time of the previous reboot.

Expected results:
Consistent times - that is, the date command in the script does not show
a time several hours before the script was run.

Additional info:","@reboot        nice run-parts /root/cron.reboot

Inside `/root/cron.reboot/000_resume_boinc.sh`:
```bash
set -x
cd /root
date ""+%X""
sleep 5
date ""+%X""
```

Reboot the system and check the cron job mail output for inconsistent times."

When the locale isn't UTF-8, expand and unexpand tools don't correctly manage files having an UTF-8 BOM header. With expand, some spaces are missing and with unexpand, there is some extra spaces so the result aren't correct.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
Fedora-20
coreutils-8.21-21.fc20.x86_64

How reproducible:
See below

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Write an UTF-8 file (file_spaces) having a BOM header with the following contents:
    é   à   ç
    é   à   ç

Two lines with four spaces + 'é' + three spaces + 'à' + three spaces + 'ç' + EOL

It's important to test with stressed characters. With ASCII characters, only the first line is incorrect and the second one is OK. With stressed characters, all lines are incorrect.

NB: For writing files with BOM header, I'm using the scite editor.

2. LANG=C unexpand -t4 file_spaces > file_unexpand

3. Edit the two files (e.g. with gedit or scite) and see the problem in file_unexpand

4. Write an UTF-8 file (file_tabs) having a BOM header with the following contents:
    é   à   ç
    é   à   ç

Two lines with one tab + 'é' + one tab + 'à' + one tab + 'ç' + EOL

5. LANG=C expand -t4 file_tabs > file_expand

Below is the patch file. The update was generated by a script. Though I can not guarantee that the original file from several months or years ago was generated by the same script but it seems it might be.

I tried to use different sort options and combine that with either field separator "":"" or no separator option but was unable to produce the original sorting order to reduce the patch size. The new sort order seems to be rather incorrect to move the 0:0:1 past 0:0:1f on numeric sort on both field separator : or no separator.

Terminal sessions display quotes for files with spaces in them. This is non-intuitive behavior. The file name does not have quotes unless quotes have been used in the filename. The coreutil ls has been updated to default to this new behavior. This behavior should not be foisted on users but users should be allowed to choose whether they want to OPT IN. Debian and Ubuntu distros have already reverted.

Steps to Reproduce:

2. ls

Actual results:
'File with spaces.txt'

Expected results:
File with spaces.txt

Additional info:
This is a core expectation. The filename we see should be the same as the filename in use. We do not require additional tools to help us identify what is a complete filename and what is not. ESPECIALLY in the terminal session where the user is expected to be versant in POSIX. If the user needs hand-holding, they can use the GUI tools like Dolphin or Konqueror. Note - neither of these tools shows 'quotes' around files with space in the name. Neither does Windows. Neither does Mac OS.

Please revert. Please instruct coreutils developers to revert. Please set any defaults required to not show the quotes. The user should not have to discover there is no error.

E.g. I downloaded an MP3 file today with spaces. I saw the single quotes and immediately thought there was a problem in firefox naming the file on download.

Although the 'rm' utility has a -I option the coder has arbitrarily decided that more than 3 files is the magic number of files which determines whether a prompt to remove is issued or not. So why wasn't the -I option simply allowed to take an arg such as ""-I 3"" or ""-I 1""?  Hard coding some arbitrary number according to the preferences of one individual programmer is very poor form. Why provide a crippled option?

In fedora 19 the udev scripts described here work perfectly:

http://home.comcast.net/~tomhorsley/hardware/solidoodle/solidoodle-udev.html

Part of what happens in those scripts is starting background tasks using nohup to avoid the udev tendency to kill things that take ""too long"".

In fedora 20, the ~/scripts/solidoodle-on script described in the web page above always dies in the ""sleep 5"" as something apparently kills it because it is taking too long (I guess). If I remove the sleep 5, the RepetierHost splash screen comes up, but then is killed almost immediately.

So nohup doesn't seem to be preventing the killing of the background job any longer.

During shell startup, an unnecessary directory scan of the current directory is performed, which can cause a noticeable delay if the current directory is large or slow to access (such as over nfs).

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

coreutils-7.2-7.fc11.x86_64

How reproducible:

Always.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. cd to a large directory (I noticed this in /usr/share/man/man3)
2. echo exit | script -c ""strace -f bash 2>&1"" /dev/stdout | less
3. search for blocks of consecutive getdents calls. Two instances of scanning /etc/profile.d can be ignored. After these the next instance is a scan of the current directory.
  
Actual results:

Shell is slow to start if the current directory is slow to enumerate.

Expected results:

Shell startup time would ideally be as independent as possible of the current directory.

Additional info:

For most shells, /etc/profile.d/colorls.sh is executed. Line 33 is:

    eval `dircolors --sh ""$COLORS"" 2>/dev/null`

dircolors produces a shell snippet that defines and exports LS_COLORS, which itself contains a list of glob patterns and their corresponding colour mappings. So the above expands to, roughly:

    eval LS_COLORS='......:*.tgz=01;31:....'; export LS_COLORS

The single quoting which normally supressed globbing in that line is interpreted in within the command line of the eval, what finally gets executed by the eval has had the quotes stripped so undergoes pathname expansion. Unless you're in a very weird directory when this happens, this will fail and leave the string unmodified, but not before scanning the current directory ""just in case"".

(Attempts to make the expansion do anything more interesting usually fail with ENAMETOOLONG, but I suppose if you could get a user to launch a shell in a chosen directory in a filesystem with an unfeasibly large name limit containing a file with a chosen name, you could inject arbitrary strings into the user's LS_COLORS variable. For example if the user's home directory is mounted on such a filesystem and an attacker can create, or persuade the user to create, such a file there. That could then perhaps be used to hide certain files (including the one that triggered this), or inject arbitrary escape sequences into ls output attempting to exploit terminal emulator bugs.)

To preserve the quotes into the eval the arguments must be double-quotes:

    eval ""`dircolors --sh ""$COLORS"" 2>/dev/null`""

A similar problem probably exists in /etc/profile.d/colorls.csh (for C-shell type shells) but my csh-fu is too weak to know for sure.","```bash

At one time in history, the ""-l"" option on the ""df"" command worked fine even when some NFS mounted filesystems were not talking (because, for instance, the remote system is down or troubled in some way).

Now, df issues a stat() for every dadgum mountpoint, even when called with the -l option. If an NFS mount is having trouble this can hang forever (with the right mount options). The whole point of -l was to avoid this (well, a major point, anyway).


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
coreutils-8.21-21.fc20.x86_64


How reproducible:
100%

Steps to Reproduce:
1.run strace df -l -h on a system with network mounts.
2.grep the strace output for stat() calls.
3.see stat() calls for every single network mount as well as the local ones.

Actual results:
Hang when there is network or server trouble

Expected results:
No hang, it shouldn't be touching anything on the network.

Additional info:
Here are some of the stat() calls from my fedora 20 system at work. All
these names are NFS mountpoints, yet I ran with the -l option:

DIR_COLORS.256color uses dark variants of the colors for directories and links which are sometimes hard to read; DIR_COLORS variants look fine.

I've tested two terminals -- GNOME 3.14 gnome-terminal (TERM=xterm-256color, dark gray background) and xterm (TERM=xterm-256color, white background) and both look better with light variants:

The directories are dark blue in DIR_COLORS.256color variant. They're near to unreadable with GNOME terminal while the light variant is fine and looks better in white xterm too.

The symbolic links are dark cyan in DIR_COLORS.256color which is barely readable in white xterm. The light variant looks better in xterm as well as in GNOME.

Same apples to red (for *.rpm files?) -- light variant looks better on white xterm as well as on dark GNOME.

The light variants are used in grep and systemd tools and seems like they're a more interoperable choice for different backgrounds.

Please consider using more light variants by default for 256 color terminals.

Behavior:

The setup script /etc/profile.d/colorls.csh works fine in a stock F19
installation, but if a local admin adds a default shell setting of
""noclobber"" in a profile setting that runs before this script (as we do)
then the script will error out with an error of:

/tmp/.colorlsXXX: File exists.

Cause:

The script creates that temporary file with mktemp, but on the first
write it uses only a single redirect (>), which fails when noclobber is set.

Since the file is already created, I think we can safely use an append
redirect (>>) in all cases where that file is written to, which works
regardless of the state of the noclobber settting.

Patch:

35c35
< if ( ""$INCLUDE"" != '' ) cat ""$INCLUDE"" > $TMP

> if ( ""$INCLUDE"" != '' ) cat ""$INCLUDE"" >> $TMP","To reproduce the bug, you can use the following command sequence:

```bash
set noclobber
/tmp/profile.d/colorls.csh

This sets the `noclobber` option in the shell and then runs the script that is known to cause issues when `noclobber` is set."

It's very hard to see in a quick glance whether some of the files are corrupted, because the output is full of errors about missing files. Yes, I could use grep to filter them out, but that's equally inconvenient as examining the output carefully.

In term of automation, the exit status is non-zero when some files are missing. I haven't found an easy way to ignore missing files and check the rest. So even automating this is hard.

Please implement something like --ignore-missing option, that could be used together with --check. It would not print any warnings about missing files, and they would not affect the exit status of the process.

Thank you.

To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:

### 1. Set Up Environment

Make sure you have `abrt` installed on the system:
```sh
sudo yum install abrt  # On CentOS/RHEL
sudo apt-get install abrt  # On Ubuntu/Debian
```

Enable and start the ABRT service if it is not already running:
```sh
sudo systemctl enable abrtd
sudo systemctl start abrtd
```

### 2. Run Sleep Command

Try running the `sleep` command in a loop to simulate high usage, which might increase the likelihood of reproducing the issue:
```sh
while true; do /bin/sleep 10 & done
```
Or run it with various parameters (this is more likely if certain sleep values are problematic):
```sh
for i in {1..3600}; do /bin/sleep $i & done
```

### 3. Monitor ABRT

Monitor the ABRT logs to see if any core dumps are generated:
```sh
sudo journalctl -u abrtd -f
# or look at the specific log file for ABRT coredumps
tail -f /var/log/messages | grep abrt
```

### 4. Analyze Core Dumps

Once a core dump is generated, use `abrt-cli` to investigate:
```sh
sudo abrt-cli list
sudo abrt-cli info <problem_id>
# Optionally, analyze the coredump with gdb
gdb /bin/sleep /var/spool/abrt/ccpp-<timestamp>.new/coredump
```

### 5. Additional Checks

Check for any kernel panic messages or other system logs that could indicate an underlying hardware or software issue:
```sh
dmesg | grep -i error
tail -f /var/log/messages
```

By performing these steps, you should be able to reproduce the bug and gather more information about what is causing the `sleep` command to crash. If you can reliably reproduce this issue, consider reporting it to the appropriate maintainers with detailed logs and system specifications."

1190208,"Description of problem:
Hello,
there seems to be some issues how the ""/usr/bin/date"" utility from coreutils is handling time when using the TZ environment settings to change the time-zone. 
This could have some negative impact if for example using it to check some timestamps for example during the forensic investigation.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
coreutils-8.22-19

How reproducible:
100%

Situation:
I am in time-zone GMT+1 ... means when there is 15:00 i Greenwich, then there is already +1 hour here in Prague 16:00.

$ date           #Current local datetime
Fri Feb  6 16:00:00 CET 2015

$ TZ=Europe/Prague date #Current datetime in Prague 
Fri Feb  6 16:00:00 CET 2015


$ date --utc     #Current datetime in UTC using the --utc argument
Fri Feb  6 15:00:00 UTC 2015

$ TZ=UTC date    #Current datetime in UTC using the TZ environment variable
Fri Feb  6 15:00:00 UTC 2015

$ TZ=Europe/London date #Current datetime in London
Fri Feb  6 15:00:00 CET 2015


... so far so good


Issue: When using TZ environment variable with the UTC offset the date utility actually counts in oposite direction then it should

#Should be current date displayed in UTC+1 timezone, but actually that is UTC-1
$ TZ=UTC+1 date  
Fri Feb  6 14:00:00 UTC 2015

#Should be current date displayed in UTC+2 timezone, but actually that is UTC-2
$ TZ=UTC+2 date
Fri Feb  6 13:00:00 UTC 2015

#Should be current date displayed in UTC+3 timezone, but actually that is UTC-3
$ TZ=UTC+3 date
Fri Feb  6 12:00:00 UTC 2015

End of assembler dump.","The provided core dump indicates that a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) occurred within the `pause` system call. However, given the context, this could be an artifact of how the signal handler interacts with the program, particularly if there is some misuse of memory or incorrect handling of signals.

However, based on what has been provided, it seems like you have a binary that, when executed, might end up in a state where the `pause` system call is invoked and then a segmentation fault happens. Since no specific code or context around how `pause` is being used is provided, reproducing this issue requires some guessing based on common patterns.

One scenario could be if there's an incorrect manipulation of the stack pointer inside a signal handler, which could cause undefined behavior when `pause` is called. Here’s a test case to try and replicate this:

1. Write a simple C program that sets up a signal handler for a specific signal (e.g., SIGUSR1) that modifies the stack pointer in an incorrect way.
2. Call `pause` in the main function of the program.

Here's an example code snippet to illustrate this scenario:

```c
#include <signal.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void handle_signal(int sig) {
    // Incorrectly manipulate the stack pointer
    asm(""mov $0xdeadbeef, %rsp"");
}

int main() {
    struct sigaction sa;
    sa.sa_handler = handle_signal;
    sa.sa_flags = 0;
    sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);

    if (sigaction(SIGUSR1, &sa, NULL) == -1) {
        perror(""sigaction"");
        return 1;
    }

    printf(""Process ID: %d\n"", getpid());
    printf(""Send SIGUSR1 to this process to trigger the signal handler.\n"");

    // Call pause
    pause();

    return 0;
}
```

To test this:

1. Compile the program using `gcc -o faulty_signal faulty_signal.c`.
2. Run the program: `./faulty_signal`.
3. Note the process ID printed in the output.
4. Send the SIGUSR1 signal to the process (replace `<PID>` with the actual PID from step 2): `kill -SIGUSR1 <PID>`

This example deliberately causes a segmentation fault by setting the stack pointer to an invalid address inside the signal handler before calling `pause`. The actual bug in your scenario might be different, but this can serve as a starting point for debugging.

If the issue isn't related to signal handling and incorrect stack manipulation, please provide more context about how `pause` is used in your application."

1055597,"Use sort from coreutils-8.21-20.fc20.x86_64 seems to (sometimes) produce incorrectly ordered results. Using this input:

x 1 dsfdfdsf
x2 1 dsfdfdsf
x2 2 dsfdfdsf
x 2 dsfdfdsf

and ""sort -k 1,1 -k 2n,2"" does not seem to correctly order on the primary key, giving:

x 1 dsfdfdsf
x2 1 dsfdfdsf
x2 2 dsfdfdsf
x 2 dsfdfdsf

removing the trailing data from each line causes the results to be as expected, as does adding ""i"" to the first key so that ""sort -k 1i,1 -k 2n,2"" gives the expected result:

x 1 dsfdfdsf
x 2 dsfdfdsf
x2 1 dsfdfdsf

  the xfce4-session.  After a normal working desktop startup, there's

  apparently waiting for some synchronization event which doesn't happen.
  Just a guess...

** Improvements

  base64 encoding throughput for bulk data is increased by about 60%.

  md5sum can use libcrypto hash routines where allowed to potentially
  get better performance through using more system specific logic.
  sha1sum for example has improved throughput by 40% on an i3-2310M.
  This also affects sha1sum, sha224sum, sha256sum, sha384sum and sha512sum.

  stat and tail work better with EFIVARFS, EXOFS, F2FS, HOSTFS, SMACKFS, SNFS
  and UBIFS.  stat -f --format=%T now reports the file system type, and tail -f
  now uses inotify for files on all those except SNFS, rather than the default
  (for unknown file system types) of issuing a warning and reverting to polling.

  shuf outputs subsets of large inputs much more efficiently.
  Reservoir sampling is used to limit memory usage based on the number of
  outputs, rather than the number of inputs.

  shred increases the default write block size from 12KiB to 64KiB
  to align with other utilities and reduce the system call overhead.

  split --line-bytes=SIZE, now only allocates memory as needed rather
  than allocating SIZE bytes at program start.

Description of problem
----------------------

coreutils fails to build if ""-Werror=format-security"" flag is used.

...

test-xvasprintf.c:98:5: error: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Werror=format-security]

...

We are working on a proposal to enable ""-Werror=format-security"" for all
packages. Once this flag is enabled, GCC will refuse to compile code that could
be vulnerable to a string format security flaw. For more details, please see
https://fedorahosted.org/fesco/ticket/1185 page.

To understand why it is important to fix this, please see
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Format-Security-FAQ page.

How to fix this
---------------

The fix for these errors is quite simple. It's a matter of changing a
line like,

   printf(foo);

to read,

   printf(""%s"", foo);

That's it.

Please fix this issue in rawhide with a patch (which you should submit
to upstream to merge moving forward). Please do a new build with the
fix in rawhide. Other releases do not need to be directly fixed, but
there should be no harm in pushing out this fix/patch with other needed
changes to those branches.

In the event you don't fix this bug before the next mass rebuild,
provenpackagers may step in and update your package(s) to fix this
issue.

Usually, people use ""-f"" to make the call idempotent. But this doesn't work when combined with --relative apparently.

Also, adding -n or -T doesn't fix this either. It won't fail then anymore, but it does generate a broken link every second time. Rewriting this to use ""-t"" doesn't make it any better...","```bash

User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; 
SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

Description of problem:
The md5sum and sha1sum programs both take a -c option to have them 
check that a file matches its checksum.

md5sum will return nothing if the checksum is okay, otherwise it will 
complain.
sha1sum will print a message saying ""OK"" if it's checksum is okay, 
otherwise it will also complain.

Both programs only seem to take notice of their own checksums, i.e. 
when passed a file using -c, sha1sum ignores MD5sums, and md5sum 
ignores SHA1sums.
I'm not sure if this is by design, but if it is, this enables 
multiple checksum formats to be stored in the same file.

What would be nice if there was a wrapper command that ran both 
md5sum and sha1sum on a given file, and complains if any checksums 
are bad.

This could address the issue of a checksumming algorithm being 
compromised.

1048547,"I am on Fedora 20 using coreutils 8.21-18. Unfortunately I figured out that the ""sort"" command causes massive issues by sorting large chunks of text containing umlauts and a few other characters.

Explaination:
For backup purposes I create a large textfile with filenames and md5sums. Whenever I do a new or updated backup I compare both textfiles and see the differences of the names (versions and md5sums) that got changed.

With Fedora 18 the sorting algorythm was ok but with Fedora 20 and the applied ""multibyte"" fix from August the situation changed. The output generated by sort from Fedora 20 is different to the output generated by Fedora 18.

This is no locale issue because that's what I verified first.

When I ls -l a directory with names for example then the umlauts and other chars are sorted correctly. As soon as I use the same output (e.g. ls -l &> log) and use sort -k9 over that log file then the output is differently to what ls sorted. I also used rsync to verify it by copying over the directory to another dir and even rsync correctly copies the files sorted the same way ls shows it sorted.

I also experimented by using a bunch of text sorting algorithms under Java and even those sort them correctly.

Sadly because of this I now have to review all my work since 16 December 2013 where I used or piped the coreutils sort to fix the issues that might have caused by it.

A small fix (which seem to be not correct) with huge impact because of all the work that I have to do now.

Please review the patch and compare the resulting output with other applications and sorting algorithms.",None

Locale definition for en_GB.UTF-8 updated but version info unchanged, 'date' problems.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
* Locales installed by anaconda and/or
* coreutils.i686 8.21-20.fc20 ('date' provider)

How reproducible:
Always, provided the causing locale file is installed.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. at bash cli, using locale en_GB.UTF-8, execute 'date'
2. copy resulting date o/p, paste into a 'date -d ""<pasteHere>""'
3. 'date' should report ""date: invalid date ‘<date>’""

Actual results:
[prt@F20 locales]$ date
Sun 26 Jan 17:49:24 GMT 2014
[prt@F20 locales]$ date -d ""Sun 26 Jan 17:49:24 GMT 2014""

Expected results:
'date' doesn't choke when passed it's own localised output!

Additional info:
Probably not coreutils fault although it affects 'date';root cause appears to be dodgey change to en_GB local definition (No version change despite obvious change). Full story below - sorry, newbie here and don't do 'brief' yet!
Files and more info available on request.

Hi There.
I am in the process of changing from a Fedora 12 to Fedora 20 environment.
As part of this, I perform a check that my homebrew scripts still run ok.
I noticed that after a clean 'minimal' install onto a spare machine that these regression tests were failing due to diffences in the default output format of the 'date' command. (Thinks:Should have used an unambiguous method for date processing!)
* Fedora 12 output : 'Sun Jan 26 16:34:12 GMT 2014'
* Fedora 20 output : 'Sun 26 Jan 16:35:18 GMT 2014'
We see above that the month identifier and day number are reversed.

Also, on the F20 machine with the 'stock' locale, 'date' no longer appears able to accept it's own default output as a valid date:
[prt@ibmT42 locales]$ date
Sun 26 Jan 17:49:24 GMT 2014
[prt@ibmT42 locales]$ date -d ""Sun 26 Jan 17:49:24 GMT 2014""
date: invalid date ‘Sun 26 Jan 17:49:24 GMT 2014’
[prt@ibmT42 locales]$
....whereas on the F12 Machine, this works fine:
[prt@thinkpad ~]$ date
Sun Jan 26 17:50:34 GMT 2014
[prt@thinkpad ~]$ date -d ""Sun Jan 26 17:50:34 GMT 2014""
Sun Jan 26 17:50:34 GMT 2014
[prt@thinkpad ~]$

Now
Looking at the F20 machine's local definition for 'en_GB' in usr/share/i18n/locales/en_GB, this describes itself as 'Revision: 4.3' with a date of '1996-10-15'.
Looking at the F12 machine's local definition for 'en_GB' in usr/share/i18n/locales/en_GB, this describes itself as 'Revision: 4.3' with a date of '1996-10-15'.
...in other words, they should be the same file....however, they are not. An md5sum of the same file on the different machines shows :-
F12:d4fe884db5f0df12e5e2dd12709d4e09  /usr/share/i18n/locales/en_GB
F20:7340ace57403b98e8039c57d1392203b  /usr/share/i18n/locales/en_GB
...and a simple 'diff' of the two files shows :-
[prt@ibmT42 locales]# diff en_GB-F12 en_GB-F20
119c119
< am_pm       ""<U0041><U004D>"";""<U0050><U004D>""
---
> am_pm       ""<U0061><U006D>"";""<U0070><U006D>""
121c121
< date_fmt      ""<U0025><U0061><U0020><U0025><U0062><U0020><U0025><U0065>/
---
> date_fmt    ""<U0025><U0061><U0020><U0025><U0065><U0020><U0025><U0062>/
[prt@ibmT42 locales]#
....showing changes in the am/pm indicator formats and the 'date_fmt'

Changing the F20 Machines en_GB locale 'back' sorts my problem out :
[root@ibmT42 locales]# date;localedef -f UTF-8 -i en_GB-F12 en_GB.UTF-8;date
Sun 26 Jan 18:13:16 GMT 2014
Sun Jan 26 18:13:18 GMT 2014
[root@ibmT42 locales]#
....and furthermore 'date' can now understand it's own output!
[root@ibmT42 locales]# date -d ""Sun Jan 26 18:13:18 GMT 2014""
Sun Jan 26 18:13:18 GMT 2014
[root@ibmT42 locales]#

I'm fine with changes like this, particularly with a big step like the one I'm taking (F12 -> F20!)..however what I'm NOT ok with is that someone has been changing the locale-defining file for my 'en_GB' locale but NOT updating the human-readable version identification in the file....totally breaks the concept of issue control and fooled me until I actually compared the file contents rather than believing the version info I read :-)
I've not checked, but I bet locale defs other than en_GB have this 'issue' as well.

Also, this change has the capacity to 'break' date in a particular circumstance.

Paul","```bash

However, if we interpret this as a task where you want to ensure the colors are applied correctly (which could be considered as verifying functionality), here's how you can set up your environment and verify that the color scheme works as expected:

1. **Save the Configuration:**
   - Save the provided configuration into a file named `dircolors.conf`.

2. **Apply the Color Scheme:**
   - To apply this color scheme, you need to source the `LS_COLORS` variable in your shell's startup script (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`). You can do this by adding the following line:
     ```bash
     eval ""$(dircolors ~/.config/dircolors.conf)""
     ```
   - Alternatively, if you want to use the system-wide `LS_COLORS` and have `dircolors` automatically load your custom file when it's available in a standard location, place the configuration file at one of these paths: 
     - `~/.dir_colors`
     - `/etc/DIR_COLORS`

3. **Test the Color Scheme:**
   - To test whether the color scheme is applied correctly, you can use the `ls` command with color output enabled. Run:
     ```bash
     ls --color=auto
     ```
   - Alternatively, if your shell already uses color (like in many modern distributions), simply running:
     ```bash
     ls
     ```
     should display files and directories using the specified colors from your `dircolors.conf`.

4. **Verify Specific File Types:**
   - To ensure that specific file types are colored as expected, create or find files of each type mentioned in the configuration and run `ls` to see if they match the desired color. For example:
     ```bash
     touch test.pdf test.mp3 test.jpg
     ls --color=auto
     ```
   - Check if `test.pdf` is brown, `test.mp3` is cyan, and `test.jpg` is magenta.

5. **Adjustments:**
   - If you find that certain colors are not being applied as expected or need to adjust the configuration, modify the `dircolors.conf` file accordingly and reload it using the method described in step 2.

By following these steps, you can verify that the `dircolors` configuration is correctly set up and applied in your terminal environment."

sort command seems to ignore locale completely

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
coreutils-8.21-18.fc20.x86_64

How reproducible:
Set locale to e.g. pl_PL.UTF-8 and try to sort data with national multibyte characters.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. export LC_ALL=pl_PL.UTF-8
2. echo -e ""ą\na\nb\nc\nć\nł\nz\nż\nź"" | sort

Actual results:

Expected results:

Additional info:
Looks like a problem with the i18n coreutils patch. This part:

-    }
   else if (! (diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN (alen, blen))))
     diff = alen < blen ? -1 : alen != blen;

removes call to xmemcoll0(), leaving the final comparison to memcmp() which is not locale-aware. Bringing the removed part back restores correct default sort order for me, though I guess it doesn't eliminate the problem completely (for example, it doesn't fix ""sort -d"" which erroneously ignores multibyte letters).","```bash

behaves differently then I would expect — even if that seems to be really
corner case.  So marking this as low priority.  I tried to build upstream
coreutils and it works as expected (and in virtual debian 7 it works also OK).

Try the behavior of uniq in FC20 (x86_64) on attached file:

  $ cat data | LC_ALL=C uniq
  xrandr --output VGA1 --left-of LVDS1

  $ cat data | LC_ALL=en_US.utf8 uniq

Additional info:","The provided information about the bug seems somewhat incomplete and does not provide concrete steps to reliably reproduce the issue. However, based on the context given, here are some suggestions for how you might go about reproducing this problem:

1. **Install the same version of `coreutils` and `glibc`:**
   Make sure that your system is configured with the exact versions of `coreutils` (8.22-2.fc21.x86_64) and `glibc` (2.18.90-18.fc21.x86_64) as those mentioned in the bug report.

   ```bash
   sudo yum downgrade coreutils-8.22-2.fc21.x86_64 glibc-2.18.90-18.fc21.x86_64
   ```

2. **Set up a similar environment:**
   If you're using Koji, Rawhide, or any other specific setup, try to replicate that environment as closely as possible.

3. **Run the `yum update` command with the specified options:**
   Execute the same `yum` command mentioned in the bug report to see if it triggers the issue again.
   
   ```bash
   sudo yum update -x mutter\* --skip-broken
   ```

4. **Test with specific files:**
   The backtrace suggests that the problem might be related to a specific file or input when using `uniq`. If you can identify the exact files being processed, try running `uniq` on them manually to see if it causes a crash.

5. **Use valgrind for memory debugging:**
   Run `valgrind` with `uniq` to detect any memory-related issues.
   
   ```bash
   valgrind --tool=memcheck /usr/bin/uniq [your_input_file]
   ```

6. **Check system logs:**
   Look at the system logs (`/var/log/messages`, `/var/log/syslog`, etc.) for any relevant information about the crash.

7. **Test on a clean environment:**
   If possible, try reproducing this issue in a clean virtual machine or container with the same software versions to isolate external factors.

8. **Check for known issues:**
   Look through existing bug reports and mailing lists to see if others have encountered similar problems.

Unfortunately, without more detailed steps or context about what might be triggering the crash, it's difficult to provide definitive instructions for reproducing this specific issue. The above suggestions should help you create a testing environment that closely mirrors the original setup and make it easier to identify the root cause of the problem."

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. mock -r fedora-12-x86_64 init

Then check /var/log/messages and /var/cache/abrt/
  
Actual results:

abrt generates a /var/cache/abrt/ccpp* (comprising a coredump) indicating
""chcon --reference=/dev/null /var/lib/mock/fedora-12-x86_64/root/dev/null""

Due to the limitations of abrt (Likely a uid issue; the uid this chcon call is being run under doesn't match the interactive user), this report is never being reported to abrt-gui.

Expected results:

* chcon not to dump core.

* abrt to report this issue to the user having launched mock.

1044801,"Description of problem:

Starting with today's rawhide, the kernel builds have been failing.  Looking at the failure lead to something that didn't quite make sense, in that it was saying an file that should exist doesn't.  After poking around a bit, I noticed that during the prep for kernel.spec, we're copying the vanilla sources before patching, and that changes a relative symlink in the source into a directory of the contents of the link in the destination.  This is most easily seen here:

<mock-chroot>[root@vader kernel-3.12.fc21]# ls -l vanilla-3.12/arch/arm/boot/dts/include/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 34 Nov  3 18:41 dt-bindings -> ../../../../../include/dt-bindings
<mock-chroot>[root@vader kernel-3.12.fc21]# cp -rl vanilla-3.12 vanilla-3.13
<mock-chroot>[root@vader kernel-3.12.fc21]# ls -l vanilla-3.13/arch/arm/boot/dts/include/
total 4
drwxr-xr-x. 11 root root 4096 Dec 18 22:18 dt-bindings
<mock-chroot>[root@vader kernel-3.12.fc21]# 

This then leads to weird patch behavior not creating the file the build expects, but not presenting an error either.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

<mock-chroot>[root@vader kernel-3.12.fc21]# rpm -q coreutils
coreutils-8.22-1.fc21.x86_64
<mock-chroot>[root@vader kernel-3.12.fc21]# 

How reproducible:

Always thus far.  2 real builds and 1 scratch with coreutils-8.22-1.fc21 and testing in a mock chroot with that all seem to recreate this behavior.

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Untar something with a symlink in it
2.  cp -rl <source> <dest>
3.

Actual results:

symlink in <source> is replaced by a copy of the contents in <dest>

Expected results:

Previous coreutils-8.21 behavior preserved the symlink:

[jwboyer@zod kernel-3.12.fc21]$ ls -l vanilla-3.12/arch/arm/boot/dts/include/

coreutils-8.21-18.fc20.x86_64
[jwboyer@zod kernel-3.12.fc21]$ 

Additional info:

I have no idea if this behavior change is expected or not.  I also noticed that if I specify 'cp -rdl' it preserves the symlink and that works for both coreutils-8.21 and coreutils-8.22.  I opened the bug because I have no clue on the change, and because other packages might hit similar issues.

1003097,"Description of problem:

On Fedora 17 and earlier, this would set userdir equal to something
like /home/greearb/ when pwd was /home/greearb/git

On Fedora 19, userdir is empty.

PWD=$(pwd)
userdir=$(expr match ""$PWD"" '\(/home/[0-Z]*/\).*')

Work-around seems to be:

[[ $PWD =~ (/home/[0-Z]*/).* ]] && userdir=${BASH_REMATCH[1]}

Not sure if this is a bug in expr or my bash script, but since
it used to work and now doesn't, it might be a regression.

1025675,"In some cases we want to compute multiple checksums at once.
CPU is frequently cheaper than IO and this would allow us to read each file just once.

We're currently use cat | tee >(md5sum) >(sha256sum) etc., but that's not exactly user-friendly and I'd like to replace it with a better tool.


Here's my proposal for 'multisum' behaviour:

Usage
-----
  -b, --binary         read in binary mode
  -c, --check          read checksums from the FILEs and check them
  -t, --text           read in text mode (default)
  Note: There is no difference between binary and text mode option on GNU system.
  -s, --checksum       checksum type
  Note: Checksum type can be specified multiple times, but at least once.
        If specified when verifying checksums, only checksums for given
        checksum types will be verified.
# display list of supported checksum types?

The following three options are useful only when verifying checksums:
# *three* options? I see 4 :)
      --quiet          don't print OK for each successfully verified file
      --status         don't output anything, status code shows success
  -w, --warn           warn about improperly formatted checksum lines
      --strict         with --check, exit non-zero for any invalid input
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit


File format
-----------
\?<checksum_type>:<checksum> [* ]<path>

records should be:
* grouped by path
* ordered by checksum type within one group

Example md5sum:
mkdir -p test-data; for i in ""ab"" ""a b"" 'a\b' ""a\nb""; do echo ""$i"" > ""test-data/$i""; done; md5sum -b test-data/*
7557d2f3a6ad1a3a8ebd23a94ab0c642 *test-data/a b
daa8075d6ac5ff8d0c6d4650adb4ef29 *test-data/ab

\ae2af30d93d6dbd7f6f62c775c038c60 *test-data/a\\nb


Multisum output would look like:
mkdir -p test-data; for i in ""ab"" ""a b"" 'a\b' ""a\nb""; do echo ""$i"" > ""test-data/$i""; done; multisum -b -s sha256 -s md5 test-data/*

It gives an error message on stderr about 'strip', then quits without applying the ""-m 755"".  The result is partially correct (the file is copied to the destination and not stripped), but the  destination file still has the default mode for a new file.  This is truly bad because usually the default mode is 0600, which is not executable.  Instead, the remaining options should be processed [if possible] before terminating.

Obviously I could use  bs=1G seek=10 and I'll achieve error-free result on my 4GB machine - but it is still imho a bug to trying to mmap 10GB bs when count=0 - because no memory chunk will be actually used - I assume it's cheap to add extra test for this case into dd.

However, no specific issue or bug has been described in your request. In order to help you identify the commands or test cases required to reproduce a bug, I would need more details about what the bug is.

Without knowing the exact nature of the bug (e.g., crashes, incorrect output, performance issues), it's challenging to provide specific reproduction steps. But, based on the information provided and assuming that there might be some issue related to `sort -m`, here are some general suggestions:

1. **Test with Sample Data:**
   Create several sorted files and merge them using `sort -m`. Check if the output is as expected.

   ```bash
   # Generate sample sorted files
   echo -e ""apple\nbanana\ncat"" > file1.txt
   echo -e ""dog\nelk\nfish"" > file2.txt

   # Merge sorted files
   sort -m file1.txt file2.txt
   ```

2. **Check for Crash:**
   Run the command with different combinations of arguments and data to see if it crashes.

3. **Test with Large Files:**
   Generate large files, sort them, and merge to check if there are any issues related to memory usage or performance.
   
   ```bash
   # Create large sorted file
   seq 100000 > unsorted_large_file.txt
   sort -n unsorted_large_file.txt > sorted_large_file.txt

   # Merge with another large sorted file
   seq 100001 200000 > unsorted_large_file_2.txt
   sort -n unsorted_large_file_2.txt > sorted_large_file_2.txt
   
   # Merge two sorted large files
   sort -m sorted_large_file.txt sorted_large_file_2.txt
   ```

4. **Check for Output Consistency:**
   Verify that the merged output is consistent and sorted correctly.

5. **Test Edge Cases:**
   Test edge cases like empty files, single-line files, or very large numbers.
   
   ```bash
   # Merge an empty file with a non-empty file
   touch empty_file.txt
   sort -m file1.txt empty_file.txt

   # Merge two files with only one line each
   echo ""zoo"" > single_line_1.txt
   echo ""ant"" > single_line_2.txt
   sort -m single_line_1.txt single_line_2.txt
   ```

6. **Check for Race Conditions or Parallel Issues:**
   If the bug is related to parallel processing, try running the command multiple times and under different system load conditions.

If you have more specific information about what the bug is, such as an error message, a crash report, or incorrect behavior observed, please provide that information so I can tailor my suggestions accordingly."

When I create a custom /etc/DIR_COLORS.xterm-256color, the colors chosen are still from the /etc/DIR_COLORS.256color.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
coreutils-8.17-8.fc18.x86_64


How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a custom /etc/DIR_COLORS.xterm-256color with different colors
2. start xterm with login: xterm -ls; echo $TERM should show TERM=xterm-256color
3. /bin/ls
  
Actual results:
Colors are still from /etc/DIR_COLORS.256color

Expected results:
Colors should be from /etc/DIR_COLORS.xterm-256color, since TERM=xterm-256color is more specific than 256color.

Additional info:
The script /etc/profile.d/colorls.[c]sh shows that /etc/DIR_COLORS.256color is checked first before checking /etc/DIR_COLORS.$TERM.
This test order should be changed so that /etc/DIR_COLORS.$TERM is checked first, then /etc/DIR_COLORS.256color, then /etc/DIR_COLORS
If it's not 256color mode, this precedence order works fine (specific $TERM has higher precedence than non-specific), so it is a bug in 256color mode.","```bash

Per Bug 817218 - htm files not in DIR_COLORS, I am submitting this ""sug"" at the suggestion of Ondrej Vasik

It would be great if the user local version of ~/.dir_colors had the ability to source /etc/DIR_COLORS so that a user could make changes to ~/etc/DIR_COLORS without having to give up the evolution of /etc/DIR_COLORS (either via yum or a new Fedora release)

It could allow a user to prepend any changes that he/she wishes to make over what is in /etc/DIR_COLORS and allow /etc/DIR_COLORS to handle the rest. I would think the optimal behavior would be to process ~/.dir_colors and, if a match is found, use it; otherwise, source /etc/DIR_COLORS to see what the system wants to do.

It can't depend on bash as the user might be using a different shell (I am thinking tschrc as that is the example I am seeing on my machine)

I would also like to see a html color code included in the file so, for example, ""brown"" had a #xxyyzz code for the 0x00-0xff for the rgb (""brown"" is mighty subjective (smile)).

If Ondrej or others think I need to clarify this, please let me know

+                  delimlen = mbrtowc (&wcdelim, optarg, strnlen(optarg, MB_LEN_MAX), &state);
+
+                  if (delimlen == (size_t)-1 || delimlen == (size_t)-2)
+                    ++force_singlebyte_mode;
+                  else
+                    {
+                      delimlen = (delimlen < 1) ? 1 : delimlen;
+                      if (wcdelim != L'\0' && *(optarg + delimlen) != '\0')
+                        FATAL_ERROR (_(""the delimiter must be a single character""));
+                      memcpy (mbdelim, optarg, delimlen);
+                    }
+                }

Note how the memcpy only copies the characters and doesn't add a zero terminator to mbdelim. So when we come here:

+#ifdef HAVE_MBRTOWC
+      if (MB_CUR_MAX > 1 && !force_singlebyte_mode)
+        {
+          output_delimiter_string = xstrdup(mbdelim);
+          output_delimiter_length = delimlen;
+        }

The xstrdup(mbdelim) might copy lots of (uninitialized) bytes from mbdelim because it isn't NULL terminated.

In practice there will eventually be zero byte somewhere in memory which will stop the xstrdup. But it will waste space. It looks like the rest of the code will use output_delimiter_length so it won't lead to bad results (unless the xstrdup runs out of memory or into invalid memory).","```bash

709351,"Description of problem:

Apparently in Fedora 15, there is no longer an mtab file. The df command
previously used the knowledge of bind mounts from the mtab to suppress
the duplicate entries for the original filesystem and the bind mount.

No df is printing multiple instances of the same filesystem and confusing
the heck out of people. The df command should be modified to use the
info in /proc/self/mountinfo so it can go back to printing only the
one true root filesystem and not the additional copies with roots starting
at subdirectories.

See bug 701176 for much discussion of this issue (I obviously agree with the comments in there about df needing to be fixed, but couldn't find a bugzilla on df, so I created this one).

The provided information indicates that the issue happens when the program attempts to access an invalid memory location (indicated by `ip 00000034fb438f8c sp 00007fffb1ccdd80 error 4` in the `var_log_messages` entry).

However, since we don't have a detailed backtrace or exact input that causes the issue, here are some general steps and test cases you can try to reproduce this bug:

### General Steps:
1. **Basic Usage:**
   - Try running `uniq` with simple inputs and common options to see if it crashes.
     ```bash
     echo -e ""a\na\nb\nc\nc"" | uniq
     ```

2. **Large Inputs:**
   - Test `uniq` with large files or a large amount of input data, as sometimes memory issues arise under these conditions.
     ```bash
     # Create a large file with repeated lines
     yes ""test"" | head -n 1000000 > testfile.txt
     
     # Run uniq on the large file
     uniq testfile.txt
     ```

3. **Empty Input:**
   - Test `uniq` with empty input, as this might lead to edge-case issues.
     ```bash
     echo """" | uniq
     ```

4. **Special Characters and Non-ASCII Data:**
   - Test `uniq` with inputs that contain special characters or non-ASCII data, as these might cause unexpected behavior.
     ```bash
     # Special characters
     echo -e ""a\nb\nc\n@\n#\n$"" | uniq
     
     # Non-ASCII data (for example, UTF-8 characters)
     echo -e ""a\nb\nc\né\nü\nö"" | uniq
     ```

5. **Very Large Single Lines:**
   - Test `uniq` with very long single lines to see if there's a limit on the line length.
     ```bash
     # Create a string of 1 million 'a' characters
     python3 -c ""print('a'*1000000)"" | uniq
     ```

6. **Corrupted or Malformed Input:**
   - Test `uniq` with corrupted or malformed input to see if it can handle such cases gracefully.
     ```bash
     # Create a file with random bytes
     head /dev/urandom -c 1024 > randomfile
     
     # Run uniq on the random bytes (this might not work as expected)
     uniq randomfile
     ```

### Advanced Steps:
7. **Valgrind:**
   - Use Valgrind to check for memory issues in `uniq` when running it with various inputs.
     ```bash
     echo -e ""a\na\nb\nc\nc"" | valgrind --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes uniq
     ```

8. **Core Dump Analysis:**
   - If you can reproduce the crash, analyze the core dump to get more information about where the issue occurs.
     ```bash
     gdb /usr/bin/uniq /var/spool/abrt/ccpp-2012-07-06-22:57:23-24465/coredump
     ```

### Note:
If none of these steps reproduce the bug, it might be related to specific system conditions or configurations. In that case, you can try running `uniq` in different environments (e.g., virtual machines with varying configurations) or check for any known issues or patches related to your version of `glibc` and `coreutils`.

By systematically testing these scenarios, you should be able to identify the specific input or condition that causes the segfault."

Steps to Reproduce:
1. ppc-koji build --scratch f19 coreutils-8.20-2.fc19.src.rpm
or
1. create a F19 PPC chroot, rebuild coreutils-8.20 in it
2. run the newly built factor binary with different values
3.
  
Actual results:
koji task needs to be aborted, see p.e.

sha256sum: WARNING: 2 listed files could not be read
[andre@compaq-pc i386]$

The line ""sha256sum: WARNING: 20 lines are improperly formatted"" comes from the signature. This only happens with F15's coreutils-8.10-2.fc15, not with F14's coreutils-8.5-7.fc14, F16's coreutils-8.12-2.fc16, or Rawhide's coreutils-8.12-6.fc17. Not a big deal, just a little disturbing. The signature itself is fine and this happens with either recent or old signature files, so it's purely a change in coreutils. Will F15's coreutils be updated to a version that gets rid of this?

Changing user with ""su"" does not result, even if properly setup, in ~/Private mounted, as it does for other login cases.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
coreutils-8.10-2.fc15.i686

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Login using ssh, see bug #718807
2.
Use ""su - user"" in order to re-login
  
Actual results:
~/Private is not mounted

Expected results:
~/Private should be mounted

Additional info:
As mentioned in bug #718807, it seems the pam configuration is not correct since ""postlogin"" is not include in ""/etc/pam.d/su"" and maybe others.",su - user

The same process repeats over and over again.

To help in reproducing this bug, here are some steps you can follow:

1. **Run `md5sum` Command:**
   Start with running the basic `md5sum` command on various files to see if it crashes.
   
   ```bash
   md5sum /path/to/some/file
   ```

2. **Try Different Inputs:**
   Test `md5sum` with different types of input, including:
   - Empty files
   - Large files (e.g., 1GB or more)
   - Special characters in the file names
   - Binary files
   
   ```bash
   md5sum /path/to/emptyfile
   dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1024 > largefile; md5sum largefile
   md5sum ""/path/to/file with spaces and special!@#$%^&*()characters""
   md5sum /usr/bin/somebinaryfile
   ```

3. **Run in a Loop:**
   Try running `md5sum` in a loop to see if it crashes after multiple runs.
   
   ```bash
   for i in {1..100}; do md5sum /path/to/some/file; done
   ```

4. **Check with Different File Descriptors and Redirections:**
   Test `md5sum` with different file descriptors and redirections, to see if this causes a crash.
   
   ```bash
   md5sum < /path/to/some/file
   echo -n ""data"" | md5sum
   ```

5. **Test with Pipe and Other Commands:**
   Test `md5sum` when used in combination with pipes and other commands, to see if this causes a crash.
   
   ```bash
   cat /path/to/some/file | md5sum
   ls -lR /some/directory | md5sum
   ```

6. **Check for Race Conditions:**
   Test `md5sum` in a multi-threaded environment, to see if there are any race conditions.
   
   ```bash
   while true; do (md5sum /path/to/some/file &); done
   ```

7. **Use Core Dumps to Diagnose:**
   If the program crashes again, you can use `gdb` or other debuggers to analyze core dumps and find out where exactly the crash is occurring.
   
   ```bash
   gdb /usr/bin/md5sum /var/spool/abrt/ccpp-2012-10-31-13:09:18-25494/coredumpfile
   ```

By systematically testing `md5sum` with different inputs and conditions, you should be able to reproduce the crash and gather more information on what is causing it."

Several of the tests after build invoke a utility 'setuidgid'.  Unfortunately in doing so it is most likely that the wrong program executes.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
coreutils-7.6-8

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  create an executable file, say 'rm', in your path so that it executes by default and always produces a syntax error
2. run the tests/no-give-up script
  
Actual results:
2. You will see the syntax error

Expected results:
2. You should see the src/rm run and complete successfully

Additional info:
The problem occurs when the following is invoked:
""setuidgid nobody env PATH=/path/to/src:<oldpath> rm --version"".
Now setting a new PATH is a brilliant idea except what if user 'nobody' doesn't have read permission on the compiler's home directory?  I know that I never allow user 'nobody' to read in any of my home directories.  The consequence of this is that a path search will never match the src/rm instance.

But the silly thing is that the PATH is prefixed with /path/to/src so why not forget about the path and simple invoke /path/to/src/rm directly?  That is guaranteed to work since the src/rm and build directories give others execute permission (this is ensured in various scripts).

In any case the consequence of this bugs is that often the test scripts will actually be testing the already installed programs which exists somewhere else in the PATH rather than the newly compiled programs!

Question is: Who tests the test suites?  Who tests the testers?

This is a fantastic example which demonstrates that having automated test suites are generally no better than not having them.  Because bugs in the test suite will give people a false sense that the test suites are actually proving something.  You would need to create new test-suites that test the test-suites ad infinitum.","```bash
setuidgid nobody env PATH=/path/to/src:<oldpath> rm --version
```"

The provided backtrace and description do not offer any clear indication of specific input values or conditions that led to the crash. The `md5sum` command was being used on a file named ""-"", which typically represents standard input in Unix-like systems. However, without knowing what data was fed into stdin at the time of the execution, it's impossible to reproduce this exact scenario.

If there is any additional context or if the bug report mentions specific steps leading up to the crash, those details would be necessary to craft a test case. Otherwise, based on the given information alone, no concrete commands can be identified for reproducing the issue."

Description of problem:
When starting a program via ""su - user -c program"" the user session can escape 
to the parent session by using the TIOCSTI ioctl to push characters into the 
input buffer.  This allows for example a non-root session to push 
""chmod 666 /etc/shadow"" or similarly bad commands into the input buffer such 
that after the end of the session they are executed. 
 
Note that merely flushing the input buffer at the end of a su session will not 
do any good because the hostile program may still be running in the background 
and pushing in characters. 
 
The runuser program (based on su.c) launches programs that do not need a 
controlling tty.  I believe that when a ""su -c"" session is launched it also 
has no need for a controlling tty. 
 
I will attach a patch to this bug report that for the case of ""su -c"" (which 
also covers all uses of ""runuser"") will call setsid() and thus prevent the 
child session from using TIOCSTI attacks.  For the case of a child session 
that does not terminate as soon as the administrator desires I have made the 
patch handle SIGINT and SIGQUIT and kill the session to return control to the 
parent. 
 
Note that this change does not handle all possible bad things that a hostile 
user may do if ""su - baduser -c whatever"" is executed, they will still have 
read/write access to the terminal just not to /dev/tty. 
 
Also note that ""su - baduser"" still has significant potential for abuse.  I 
will not attempt to fix this at the moment as I am trying to solve the case 
for daemon startup first.

However, there are no specific details given about what caused `md5sum` to crash or under what conditions it happened. To reproduce this issue, we need to simulate similar conditions that might have led to the crash.

Given that `md5sum` is a utility for computing and checking MD5 message digest, we can try the following test cases:

1. **Input Large Files:**
   Since `md5sum` reads data from files provided as arguments, feeding it very large files (e.g., several GB in size) could potentially cause memory issues or other problems.
   ```bash
   dd if=/dev/zero of=large_file bs=1G count=4 # Create a 4GB file filled with zeros
   md5sum large_file
   ```

2. **Corrupted Files:**
   Providing corrupted files might also trigger an unexpected behavior in `md5sum`.
   ```bash
   truncate -s +1M corrupt_file # Creates a sparse file, which may cause problems for some applications.
   md5sum corrupt_file
   ```
   
3. **Simultaneous File Operations:**
   Simulating simultaneous read/write operations on the same files could also cause issues if not handled correctly by `md5sum`.
   ```bash
   while true; do echo ""data"" >> file & sleep 0.1; done &
   md5sum file
   ```

4. **Memory Stress:**
   Running memory stress tests alongside `md5sum` might uncover bugs related to memory management or allocations.
   ```bash
   stress-ng --vm 2 --vm-bytes 1G --timeout 60s & # Run a memory stress test in background
   md5sum large_file
   ```

5. **Edge Cases:**
   Test `md5sum` with edge cases like special characters, null bytes, or empty files.
   ```bash
   echo -n """" > empty_file
   md5sum empty_file

   printf '\0' > null_byte_file
   md5sum null_byte_file
   
   echo ""file_with_special_chars_!@#$%^&*()_+{}|:\""<>?[];',./"" > special_chars_file
   md5sum special_chars_file
   ```

6. **Running from Different File Systems:**
   The behavior of `md5sum` might differ on different types of file systems (e.g., ext4, xfs). Try running it on a mounted network filesystem or other filesystems to see if the issue still persists.
   
7. **Run with Valgrind/Memcheck:**
   Using tools like Valgrind can help in identifying memory management issues that might be causing `md5sum` to crash.
   ```bash
   valgrind --leak-check=full md5sum large_file
   ```

Given the limited information, these are some generic test cases that could potentially help reproduce the issue. However, for an accurate reproduction of the exact scenario, more specific details about what was happening when `md5sum` crashed would be needed. If you have access to the environment where this happened, it would be ideal to try running similar operations there."

542547,"Description of problem:
All of /usr/bin/*sum utilities produce very similar output consisting of a long number of hex-digits, so that later one can't instantly understand what type of hash it is.
It was acceptable in the old md5sum-only days, but now it causes much confusion. For example, see bug #515715.
Of course, one can count the number of digits, but a) that's weird; b) different algorythms can use equal hash length.

The problem would be eliminated if *sum utils could prefix hashes with ""type-tag"", similarly to what is done in /etc/shadow.  For example, ""sha1:..."" or ""sha1/..."".
(And that is THE RIGHT THING -- data of unknown type is bad, so http introduced ""Content-type:"" header, PGP includes ""Hash:"" prefix, etc.  With current diversity of hash types, that becomes the barest necessity for *sum utils too...)

Of course, for compatibility reasons, that have to be switched on explicitly -- e.g., with ""-l"" (Label). And besides adding such tags, *sum have to understand such prefixes, but that's trivial.

However, based on the information provided, it seems like `md5sum` command might have caused the crash:

```bash
md5sum -
```

Here, `-` typically stands for standard input. If you want to try reproducing this issue, you would need to provide some input via standard input, for example using a pipe or redirection from a file.

For instance:
```bash
echo ""test"" | md5sum -
```
or
```bash
md5sum < /path/to/some/file
```

However, these are just educated guesses based on the command `md5sum` being mentioned in the backtrace. There could be other factors that might contribute to this crash which aren't apparent from the provided information."

Additional info:
""test -n $VAR"" returns 0 on both empty and non-empty string $VAR value. ""test $VAR"" and ""test -z $VAR"" give the expected values, ie. 0,1 on non-empty and 1,0 on empty $VAR values. Also, ""test -n"" gives correct output if a direct value is given.","```

However, the provided information does not directly suggest what input caused these issues.

To try to reproduce the bug, we should consider several factors:
1. The inputs being passed to `uniq`.
2. The environment (e.g., shell, other processes running, system state).
3. Specific cases that might trigger a memory access violation, which is likely causing the segfault.

Here are some commands and test cases you can use to attempt reproducing the issue:

### 1. Basic Usage
Try using `uniq` with simple inputs:
```bash
echo -e ""a\nb\nc\na"" | uniq
```

### 2. Large Inputs
Since the core dump sizes suggest a larger amount of data might be involved, try using very large input files. You can generate a large file for testing purposes:
```bash
head /dev/urandom | tr -dc '[:print:]' > largefile.txt
# Run uniq on this large file
uniq < largefile.txt
```

### 3. Special Characters and Edge Cases
Test `uniq` with special characters, including control characters and very long lines:
```bash
echo -e ""a\0b\nc\na"" | uniq
printf ""%s\n"" $(head /dev/urandom | tr -dc '[:print:]' | fold -w 10000) > longlinefile.txt
uniq < longlinefile.txt
```

### 4. Random Input Data
Generate random input data and test `uniq`:
```bash
head -c 100M /dev/urandom | tr -dc '[:print:]' > randomdata.txt
# Run uniq on this file
uniq < randomdata.txt
```

### 5. Check for Memory Corruption with Valgrind
Run `uniq` under the control of a memory debugging tool like valgrind to catch invalid memory access:
```bash
echo -e ""a\nb\nc\na"" | valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes /usr/bin/uniq
```

### 6. Environment Factors
Check if specific environment variables or shell configurations might be influencing the behavior:
- Try running `uniq` in different shells (bash, sh, zsh).
- Check if other processes are using a lot of memory that could affect `uniq`.

### 7. Reproduce with Core Dump Analysis
If you have access to one of the core dumps, you can analyze it to get more information about the state of the process when it crashed:
```bash
gdb /usr/bin/uniq <path_to_coredump>
(gdb) backtrace
```

By systematically testing these scenarios and checking for patterns in which `uniq` fails, you should be able to identify a specific set of inputs or conditions that cause the segfault. Once identified, this can help in diagnosing and fixing the underlying bug."

No comment about bundling Gnulib and no virtual provide were found in the

I have no idea what component DIR_COLORS is in so I had to leave that empty.

I am not seeing this coloring on F14 (where all my machines used to live), so the change happened in F15 or F16.

I know this is kinda trivial in the grand scheme of things, but if someone took the time to add all these codings for text files I think is is fair for me to ask that he/she covers all of them.

Given the sharing of data between machines of different OS's, I don't think it is right to have to change all *.htm to *.html.

The core dumps are stored in `/var/spool/abrt/ccpp-<timestamp>-<pid>/`. To attempt reproducing this issue, you can follow these test cases:

1. **Basic md5sum Command**: Try running the `md5sum` command with a simple input file to see if it crashes:
   ```
   echo ""hello world"" > testfile.txt
   md5sum testfile.txt
   ```

2. **Large Input File**: Test with a large file, as memory issues might be causing the crash:
   ```
   dd if=/dev/zero of=largefile bs=1M count=1024 # creates a 1GB file
   md5sum largefile
   rm largefile
   ```

3. **Empty Input File**: Test with an empty file to see if it crashes in this case as well:
   ```
   touch emptyfile.txt
   md5sum emptyfile.txt
   rm emptyfile.txt
   ```

4. **Special Characters and Long Filenames**: Test how `md5sum` handles special characters and long filenames:
   ```
   echo ""test"" > file_!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:'\"",.<>?/`.txt
   md5sum file_!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:'\"",.<>?/`.txt

   # Create a long filename (256 characters)
   LONG_NAME=$(printf ""%0.1s"" ""a""{1..256})
   touch ""$LONG_NAME""
   md5sum ""$LONG_NAME""

   rm file_!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:'\"",.<>?/`.txt
   rm ""$LONG_NAME""
   ```

5. **Non-existent File**: Test how `md5sum` handles non-existent files:
   ```
   md5sum non_existent_file
   ```

6. **Symbolic Links**: Create a symbolic link to a file and calculate the checksum using the symlink:
   ```
   ln -s testfile.txt symlink_to_testfile.txt
   md5sum symlink_to_testfile.txt
   rm symlink_to_testfile.txt
   ```

7. **Multiple Files at Once**: Test how `md5sum` behaves when given multiple files to process:
   ```
   echo ""file1"" > file1.txt
   echo ""file2"" > file2.txt
   md5sum file1.txt file2.txt

   rm file1.txt
   rm file2.txt
   ```

8. **Stress Testing**: Run `md5sum` repeatedly in a loop to see if the crashes occur:
   ```bash
   for i in {1..100}; do md5sum testfile.txt; done
   ```
   
9. **Run Under Valgrind or GDB**: Use memory debugging tools like valgrind or gdb to detect any memory issues or segmentation faults while running `md5sum`:
   ```bash
   # Install valgrind if not already installed (e.g., on Debian/Ubuntu):
   sudo apt-get install valgrind

   # Run md5sum under valgrind
   valgrind --leak-check=full md5sum testfile.txt

   # Alternatively, run with gdb:
   gdb -ex run -ex bt -ex q --args md5sum testfile.txt
   ```

10. **Check for Environment Issues**: Sometimes, the issue might be environment-specific (e.g., file system corruption). Check your file systems for errors and ensure everything is running correctly:
    ```bash
    sudo fsck /dev/sdXN # Replace XN with your partition (e.g., sda1)
    ```

These test cases should help you identify under what conditions the `md5sum` command crashes. If the issue persists, consider checking if there are any updates or patches available for your version of `coreutils`, as this is where the `md5sum` utility is included."

To diagnose and potentially reproduce the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Check Core Dumps**: Ensure that your system is configured to generate core dumps. You can check the core pattern by running:
   ```bash
   ulimit -c
   ```
   If it outputs `0`, then you need to allow core dumps:
   ```bash
   ulimit -c unlimited
   ```

2. **Locate Core Dumps**: Core dumps are usually stored in `/var/lib/systemd/coredump/` or other directories depending on the system configuration. Locate a recent core dump file related to `md5sum`.

3. **Debug with GDB**: Use gdb (GNU Debugger) to analyze the core dump and identify what causes the crash.
   ```bash
   gdb /usr/bin/md5sum <core_dump_file>
   ```
   In gdb, you can use commands like `backtrace` or `bt` to see a stack trace.

4. **Reproduce with Different Inputs**: Try running `md5sum` with different types of input files to see if certain files trigger the crash:
   - A simple text file.
   - Large binary files.
   - Empty files.
   - Files with specific patterns or characters that might be edge cases.

5. **Stress Testing**: Run `md5sum` repeatedly in a loop to simulate high load scenarios and check for stability:
   ```bash
   while true; do md5sum /path/to/file; done
   ```

6. **Environment Variables**: Check if the bug occurs with specific environment variables set. Modify or unset environment variables related to locale, language, etc.

7. **System Configuration Changes**: Verify system configurations that might affect `md5sum` such as I/O scheduler settings, kernel parameters, or file system options.

8. **Check for Updates/Patches**: Make sure your operating system and all packages are up-to-date, as the bug may have been fixed in a newer release.

9. **Review Code Changes (If Accessible)**: If you have access to the source code, review recent changes that might affect `md5sum` functionality or performance.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify conditions under which `/usr/bin/md5sum` crashes and potentially reproduce the bug reliably."

The ABRT logs indicate that there were multiple crashes occurring when this command was executed.

However, based on the given information, it's difficult to identify the exact cause or test case to reproduce the bug without more details like error messages or stack traces from the core dumps.

That being said, we can still provide a few commands and test cases that may help in reproducing the issue:

1. **Run `md5sum` with different input files**:
   Test if certain types of files cause crashes.
   
   ```bash
   md5sum /path/to/your/file
   ```

2. **Use large files as input**:
   Sometimes, memory-related issues arise when processing large files.

   ```bash
   dd if=/dev/zero of=testfile bs=1M count=1024  # Creates a 1GB file
   md5sum testfile
   ```

3. **Test `md5sum` with special characters in filenames**:
   
   ```bash
   touch ""test@#$.txt""
   md5sum ""test@#$.txt""
   ```
   
4. **Run `md5sum` concurrently on multiple files**:
   It may be related to multi-threading or memory management.

   ```bash
   for file in /path/to/your/files/*; do md5sum ""$file"" & done
   ```

5. **Use different versions of `coreutils` (if possible)**:
   Sometimes, the issue might have been resolved in a newer version.
   
6. **Generate core dumps manually and analyze them**:
   This can help you understand what went wrong. First, enable core dump generation:

   ```bash
   ulimit -c unlimited
   ```
   
   Then run `md5sum` as usual, wait for it to crash, and analyze the generated core dump using a debugger like GDB.

7. **Test with different system configurations**:
   Sometimes, bugs can be related to specific hardware or software configurations.

Remember that while these commands might help you in reproducing the issue, they may not directly point out what is causing `md5sum` to crash. Analyzing core dumps and debugging the application would provide more insight into the root cause of the problem."

The core dumps are being saved by ABRT (Automatic Bug Reporting Tool) and the core dump files all have a size of 344064 bytes.

Given this information, to reproduce the bug, you need to attempt running the `md5sum` command in scenarios that might be causing it to crash. Here are some test cases or commands that could help in reproducing the issue:

1. **Run `md5sum` with an empty file:**
   ```sh
   touch /tmp/empty_file
   md5sum /tmp/empty_file
   ```

2. **Run `md5sum` with a large file:**
   Create a large file using `dd`, then calculate its MD5 sum:
   ```sh
   dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/large_file bs=1M count=1024  # Creates a 1GB file
   md5sum /tmp/large_file
   ```

3. **Run `md5sum` with a special or corrupted file:**
   Try to create a file with special characters in its name and calculate the MD5 sum:
   ```sh
   touch '/tmp/special@#$.file'
   md5sum '/tmp/special@#$.file'
   ```
   
   Also, try using a potentially corrupted or invalid binary file:
   ```sh
   head -c 1024 /dev/urandom > /tmp/corrupted_file
   md5sum /tmp/corrupted_file
   ```

4. **Run `md5sum` with multiple files at once:**
   Create several small files and calculate the MD5 sums of all:
   ```sh
   touch /tmp/file1 /tmp/file2 /tmp/file3
   echo ""Test content"" > /tmp/file1
   echo ""Another test content"" > /tmp/file2
   md5sum /tmp/file*
   ```

5. **Run `md5sum` with input from a pipe:**
   Use `echo` to provide input directly via a pipe:
   ```sh
   echo -n ""Test string"" | md5sum
   ```

6. **Test edge cases:**
   Check if `md5sum` handles boundary conditions such as zero-length files, very large files, or invalid file paths gracefully.

7. **Run `md5sum` with SELinux/AppArmor enabled (if applicable):**
   Ensure that your system is enforcing security policies and check if the tool still crashes under these restrictions:
   ```sh
   sestatus  # Check SELinux status
   sudo aa-status  # Check AppArmor status
   ```

8. **Run `md5sum` with different locales:**
   Some applications can have issues related to locale settings, so try running `md5sum` with different locales:
   ```sh
   export LANG=C
   md5sum /tmp/empty_file

   export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
   md5sum /tmp/empty_file
   ```

If you encounter a crash during any of these tests, it should produce a core dump file that can be analyzed further to identify the root cause. Additionally, checking system logs and using tools like `gdb` to analyze the core dumps might provide more insights into what's causing the crashes."

The logs indicate multiple crashes over several days.

To diagnose and potentially reproduce this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check the Environment:**
   Ensure there are no issues with disk space or file permissions that could be causing `md5sum` to crash.
   
2. **Test with Simple Input:**
   Run `md5sum` on a small text file.
   ```sh
   echo ""test"" > testfile.txt
   md5sum testfile.txt
   ```

3. **Test with Large Files:**
   Sometimes, the issue might be related to processing large files.
   ```sh
   dd if=/dev/zero of=largefile bs=1M count=1024 # Creates a 1GB file
   md5sum largefile
   ```

4. **Test with Different Types of Files:**
   Test `md5sum` on different types of files like binary, images, and scripts.
   ```sh
   md5sum /path/to/binary/file
   md5sum /path/to/image.jpg
   md5sum /path/to/script.sh
   ```

5. **Check for File System Corruption:**
   Run file system checks to ensure there is no corruption on your disk.
   ```sh
   sudo fsck /dev/sdXN # Replace sdXN with the actual partition identifier.
   ```

6. **Run under Valgrind:**
   Use `valgrind` to check for memory leaks or illegal accesses, which could be causing crashes.
   ```sh
   valgrind --tool=memcheck md5sum testfile.txt
   ```

7. **Update the System and md5sum Utility:**
   Ensure that your system is up-to-date and `md5sum` utility is at the latest version.
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade # For Debian/Ubuntu based systems
   sudo yum update # For Red Hat/CentOS based systems
   ```

8. **Check for Hardware Issues:**
   Use tools like `memtest86+` to check memory and other hardware diagnostics to ensure there are no underlying issues.

9. **Try on Another Machine:**
   If possible, run `md5sum` with the same file(s) on another machine to see if it reproduces the issue. This can help determine whether the problem is specific to your system or not.

10. **Examine Core Dumps:**
    Check core dumps of the crashes for more detailed information about what went wrong.
    ```sh
    gdb /usr/bin/md5sum /path/to/corefile # Replace with actual path to core dump file.
    ```

If following these steps helps you reproduce the issue, it will be easier to understand the root cause and potentially fix or work around it. If not, it might indicate a more subtle or hardware-related problem that would require further investigation."

However, from the given data, it seems that this might be related to system configuration, performance issues with certain hardware devices, file system usage, or possibly some application behavior. Given the lack of explicit bug description, I will propose a general approach and some commands that could help in diagnosing issues related to the described systems.

1. **Check System Logs**:
   - Command: `journalctl`
     - This command can be used to check system logs which might contain information about hardware issues or any other errors.
   
2. **Hardware Diagnostics**:
   - Command: `lspci` and `lsusb`
     - These commands will list all PCI and USB devices, respectively. Checking the output against known hardware problems could help identify faulty devices.

3. **Network Interface Check**:
   - Command: `ifconfig` or `ip addr`
     - This command provides details about network interfaces which can be helpful if there are issues related to networking (like iwl3945, a wireless card).
   
4. **USB Device Check**:
   - Command: `lsusb`
     - Helps in listing all USB devices connected to the system. Useful for troubleshooting USB-related problems.
   
5. **File System Check and Usage**:
   - Command: `df -h` or `du -sh <directory>`
     - These commands show disk usage, helping diagnose issues related to file system space or performance.

6. **Hardware Monitoring**:
   - Command: `sensors`
     - This command can be used with a package like `lm-sensors` installed on the system to check hardware temperatures and fan speeds.
   
7. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Command: `top` or `htop` (if htop is installed)
     - These commands provide real-time information about CPU, memory, and swap usage which can help in identifying performance issues.

8. **Check Specific Application Logs**:
   - Commands to check logs for specific applications might be available (e.g., `/var/log/apache2/` for Apache web server).
   
9. **Kernel Version and Configuration Check**:
   - Command: `uname -a`
     - This command shows the kernel version and other details, which can help in diagnosing issues related to kernel-specific problems.

10. **Hardware Stress Testing (if applicable)**:
    - Tool: Stress-ng
      - If the bug seems performance-related or hardware-related, stress testing could be used to reproduce any potential system instability.

Given these commands and procedures, you should try running them on a similar setup to see if you can observe the same issues. For a specific bug, more detailed information would be necessary to formulate precise steps for reproduction."
750244,"Description of problem:
'date' command can no longer be used to set the hardware clock. It was never its true purpose, but it was a consequence and many system administrators rely on 'date' setting the hardware clock. From Fedora 16 that is no longer true, see bug #749516.

Please make adjustments in coreutils 'date' to reflect this change. Proposed changes:

1. Adjust date's man page to clearly state that this command sets system time, but not hardware time, and reference 'hwclock' command for the latter purpose.

2. If you consider it helpful, add a new CLI option to set the system clock and hardware clock in the same command, by internally calling hwclock in the end.

I think at least the first option would be very beneficial to implement.

The ""Requires: pam"" of coreutils is inadequate -- /etc/pam.d/su does an
 'include' of postlogin, but /etc/pam.d/postlogin did not exist until
 pam-1.1.3-7 .
Without /etc/pam.d/postlogin, /bin/su will fail:

  su: cannot not open session: Permission denied

with an error message in /var/log/secure:

  ... su: PAM _pam_load_conf_file: unable to open /etc/pam.d/postlogin

So the requires line in th spec file should be:

This is not likely to happen on a standard spin.  And during OS install,
/etc/pam.d/postlogin is replaced by a symlink to a generated postlogin-ac .
But by examining the following, it is apparent that coreutils really does
need postlogin, and that postlogin first appeared in pam-1.1.3-7:

  $ grep postlogin /etc/pam.d/su

/bin/ls -l on an automount directory of some nature peforms the following ops on each file:

lstat(""doc"", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|S_ISGID|0775, st_size=4096, ...}) = 0

getxattr(""doc"", ""system.posix_acl_access"", 0x0, 0) = -1 EOPNOTSUPP (Operation not supported)

and possibly also:

getxattr(""/etc"", ""system.posix_acl_default"", 0x0, 0) = -1 ENODATA (No data available)

depending on the circumstances.

The first two calls (lstat and lgetxattr) don't follow symlinks and mounts, but the second is a getxattr call which _does_ follow symlinks and mounts.  The latter can cause automount points to mount, which the former won't, at least from linux-2.6.38-rc1 onwards.

These should be consistent, and so I believe the getxattr calls should be lgetxattr calls.  Without this, the first two calls may refer to a different object to the second pair of calls.

===
* Thu Mar 19 2009 Ondrej Vasik <ovasik@redhat.com> 7.1-7
- do not ship /etc/DIR_COLORS.xterm - as many terminals
  use TERM xterm and black background as default - making
  ls color output unreadable
- shipping /etc/DIR_COLORS.lightbgcolor instead of it for
  light(white/gray) backgrounds
===

Now, I can't argue with the logic of that - TERM=xterm doesn't mean that the background is either light or dark.

*However*, as we ship Fedora we default to using white background colors in gnome-terminal and xterm. (I don't know about konsole offhand)

So it me, that if we believe that DIR_COLORS.lightbgcolor is the right set of colors with a light background, then we should make sure that people get those colors out of the box. We shouldn't ask users to:

 ln -s /etc/DIR_COLORS.lightbgcolor ~/.dircolors.xterm

to fix things to work right. (is that the preferred way to do it?)

The steps to potentially reproduce the bug would include causing a core dump in `/bin/sleep`, collecting the dump file, and then analyzing it with `gdb` for debugging.

However, from the provided data, there's no information regarding why `/bin/sleep` crashed or the specific conditions that caused the crash. `/bin/sleep` is typically used to pause execution for a specified time interval and doesn't usually encounter runtime errors on its own under normal circumstances.

To attempt to reproduce this bug, one should consider the following:

1. **Recreate the Environment**: Ensure you have the same version of `/bin/sleep`, `gdb`, libraries (e.g., libc), and kernel that were present when the core dump was generated.
   
2. **Trigger Core Dumps for /bin/sleep**:
   - Make sure your system is configured to allow core dumps by setting a limit on their size: 
     ```bash
     ulimit -c unlimited
     ```
   - Attempt to cause `/bin/sleep` to crash in some way. This could be through malicious intent (e.g., injecting signals, memory corruption), but without more information about the actual issue, it's hard to suggest a specific test case.
   
3. **Analyze Core Dump**:
   - Once you have a core dump file for `/bin/sleep`, use `gdb` in a similar manner to how it was used here to analyze the crash and generate a backtrace:
     ```bash
     gdb /bin/sleep ./coredump
     ```
   - Execute commands like those mentioned in the log (`thread apply all backtrace 2048 full`, `info sharedlib`, etc.) to see if you can identify the reason for the crash.
   
Unfortunately, without additional information about the nature of the issue (e.g., what signals were being sent, what was happening around the time of the crash), it's difficult to suggest a specific test case that would reliably reproduce this bug. If there were known conditions or inputs under which `/bin/sleep` crashed in your environment, those should be used for testing.

If you have more information about the circumstances leading up to the crash (e.g., system logs, other running processes), that could also help in constructing a test case."

End of assembler dump.","Based on the given information, the described issue involves a segmentation fault when running `/bin/sleep` with a duration argument (in this case, `5m`). However, the provided backtrace and other details do not indicate any obvious issues within the sleep command itself but rather suggest that there might be something peculiar about the environment or system libraries in use.

To reproduce the bug, one should ideally try to replicate the exact setup where the fault occurred, including:

1. **OS Version:** Check the Linux distribution version and kernel version used by the user reporting the issue.
2. **Architecture:** Verify if it was a 32-bit or 64-bit system since there might be compatibility issues related to architecture.
3. **Libc Version:** Find out the exact version of glibc (GNU C Library) that is being used, as different versions can have distinct behaviors and bugs.
4. **Environment Variables:** Check if any specific environment variables were set that could affect the behavior of `/bin/sleep` or its interaction with libraries.

A simple test case to start would be:

```bash
/bin/sleep 5m
```

If this command does not trigger a segmentation fault on your system, you should attempt to match as closely as possible the conditions present in the user's environment (such as installing the exact version of glibc used by them).

However, given that `/bin/sleep` is such a fundamental and well-tested utility, it's more likely that there could be an issue with a corrupted library or other system-specific anomaly. In such cases, reproducing the issue can be challenging without access to the original environment.

If you suspect this might be due to a corrupted library or file system issue:

1. **Check for File System Errors:** Run `fsck` on the relevant filesystems.
2. **Reinstall glibc:** If possible, reinstalling the GNU C Library may resolve any corruption issues.

Without more specific details about the environment, reproducing the bug exactly might not be feasible. However, starting with running `/bin/sleep 5m` and checking for system inconsistencies is a good place to begin."

When ln creates symbolic links with a target directory it fails to properly adjust paths in the created symbolic link.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
coreutils-8.5-7

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. touch file
2. mkdir t
3. ln -s -t t file  (OR ln -s file t)
4. ls -l t
5. ls -L t
  
Actual results:
4. lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4 2011-01-10 14:54 file -> file
5. ls: cannot access t/file: Too many levels of symbolic links

Expected results:
4. lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4 2011-01-10 14:54 file -> ../file
5. lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    0 2011-01-10 14:54 file

Additional info:
Let's face it: when ln is invoked it knows exactly what the current directory is, it knows exactly where the target directory is, it knows whether the target file has been specified with a relative path, so why doesn't it correctly create a symbolic link with the proper path relative to the target directory?  Doesn't matter for hard links, but one would hope that somebody would take the time to make relative symbolic links easier to create.  Or otherwise disallow the use of the -t option when -s is used with a relative target file.  Hard to believe that this fundamental utility has existed in such a broken state for such a long time.

More additional info:
The use of the terminology ""target directory"" is potentially confusing because the word ""target"" is also used in the context of ""target of the symbolic link"".  It is in fact the output or temporary current directory and would be better named as that (ie. -c, --current-directory). Fortunately the -c option is free for use.","```bash

When dd reads from a pipe it produces random results

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

1. Find a large file, say 10MB
2. cat largefile | dd ibs=100000 count=2 >output1
3. repeat 2) several times recording size of output1
4. dd if=largefile | dd ibs=100000 count=2 >output2

Actual results:
The size of output will vary.
2. Various sizes such as 65536,139264,143360.
5. Various sizes such as 6144,7168,6656

Expected results:
size should always be 200000, and never anything else

Additional info:
The apparent block size of a pipe ""device"" should be transparent.
But in any case, when using ibs we are instructing dd what the input block size
is!  So dd should obey our instructions, and not use other block size.
Interesting to note that a conceptually simple program like dd has been so
hacked around since v5.2 that it is a wonder it still works at all.","```bash

623545,"Description of problem:
/sbin/mount.tmpfs will emit error messages at boot time, and fails to turn
off restricted mode, if two conditions are met:
    1. A tmpfs filesystem is used (listed in /etc/fstab).
    2. /usr is a separate filesystem, mounted after a tmpfs filesystem.
The problem is simply that /sbin/mount.tmpfs uses 'id', which is in
/usr/bin/id, and hence not yet available.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
coreutils-8.4-8.fc13.i686
(The error message is emitted by /sbin/mount.tmpfs, but the easy fix is
to coreutils; see ""Additional info"" below.)

How reproducible:
100%

Steps to Reproduce:
Prerequisites:
  A tmpfs filesystem in /etc/fstab, e.g.:
      tmpfs  /tmp  tmpfs  defaults  0 0
  A separate /usr filesystem, listed after tmpfs in /etc/fstab .
Then boot (single-user will do).

Actual results:
On the system console (also in /var/log/boot.log):
  Mounting local filesystems:  /sbin/mount.tmpfs: line 22: id: command not found
  /sbin/mount.tmpfs: line 23: id: command not found
  /sbin/mount.tmpfs: line 25: [: -eq: unary operator expected

Expected results:
No error messages after ""Mounting local filesystems"".

Additional info:
Two possibilities to fix:
1. Change the location of 'id' from /usr/bin/id to /bin/id, in the coreutils
   package.
2. Make all the 'id' code in /sbin/mount.tmpfs be conditional on
   'type -t id >/dev/null', and if that fails, assume it's boot time, and
   set restricted=0 .  (No, I don't like it either.)",None

After a fresh install of Fedora 12 from Fedora 11, followed by restoring user directories from a backup, when using su to log into one of the old accounts, I encounter a long delay (about 23 seconds) before getting the shell prompt. With accounts that I create ""fresh"" (with useradd) this delay does not occur.

The way the old accounts were restored was (1) copy the data in from the backup, (2) use useradd to create a username with the old uid/gid.

Probably this is not an issue with su itself, but I don't know where else to start.

Very long delay before appearance of shell prompt. Approximately 23 seconds.

dd should have a --quiet option to suppress the often unimportant statistical output (ie. 1+0 records in, 1+0 records out, 4096 bytes ...).  Why you might ask?  Because standard error is being used by dd for something other than errors.  If one is to redirect standard error to /dev/null to get rid of the record count information then one might not see important actual error messages.

Additional info:
The record count output is relatively pointless, but in any case it would make more sense to only show such information if the user requested it (eg. with -v/--verbose).  I doubt that there are many scripts out there processing stderr to extract record counts, but many people would be used to seeing dd output its mostly useless information. Let's face it, 'cp' doesn't need to give byte count or record count feedback so you can be sure it actually did something.  It simply isn't the normal *nix way of doing things.

Anyhow there currently isn't a sensible way to separate actual error messages from the generally unnecessary record count feedback.  There should be.

If one builds coreutils configure without ""--enable-selinux"" then the resultant ls utility does not contain the ""--scontext"" command-line option.  However, the test suite library (test-lib.sh) contains a function require_selinux_ which uses ""ls --scontext"" to attempt to determine whether selinux is enabled.

Despite the continued existence of the _POSIX2_VERSION environment variable to allow use of +N[.M][flag] options the documentation for it has been removed from info file.

Expected results:

Additional info:
I have to say that the sort syntax and combinations of flags are almost completely illogical. For example, you cannot mix -b/-n flags and key-specific flags and get consistent results.  You can with the +N[.M][flag] options.
Also, if you run sort without -t flag and with key positions without -b modifier you don't get sensible or predictable results.  Naturally all of this should be the subject of another bug report, but while _POSIX2_VERSION still exists then one can use the old +N[.M][flag] style options and get perfect results all of the time. Why some clever person didn't just swap the '+' as in +N[.M][flag] with a '-' instead of inventing an inferior system of malfunctioning -k options nobody knows.","```bash

FAIL: misc/selinux (exit: 1)","Based on the provided log output, you can reproduce the issue using the following sequence of commands:

1. **Create a zero-filled file**: This serves as the virtual disk image for the filesystem.
   ```bash
   dd if=/dev/zero of=blob bs=8192 count=200
   ```

2. **Create an ext2 filesystem on the zero-filled file**:
   ```bash
   mkfs -t ext2 -F blob
   ```

3. **Mount the virtual disk image with `nouser_xattr` option**: This option disables support for extended attributes.
   ```bash
   mkdir mnt
   mount -oloop,nouser_xattr blob mnt
   ```

4. **Attempt to set an extended attribute on a file within the mounted filesystem**:
   ```bash
   touch mnt/f
   xattr_name=user.foo
   xattr_value=bar
   setfattr -n $xattr_name -v $xattr_value mnt/f
   ```

5. **Check if `setfattr` fails as expected**: The test will fail with an ""Operation not supported"" error because of the `nouser_xattr` option.
   
6. **Unmount the filesystem and clean up**:
   ```bash
   umount mnt
   rm -rf blob mnt

The critical steps for reproducing the bug are mounting the ext2 filesystem with the `nouser_xattr` option and then attempting to set an extended attribute on a file within that mounted filesystem. The error message ""Operation not supported"" indicates that the operation cannot be performed because user extended attributes are disabled.

Here's a consolidated script combining all these commands:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a zero-filled file (200 blocks of 8192 bytes each)
dd if=/dev/zero of=blob bs=8192 count=200

# Create an ext2 filesystem on the zero-filled file
mkfs -t ext2 -F blob

# Mount the virtual disk image with nouser_xattr option
mkdir mnt
mount -oloop,nouser_xattr blob mnt

# Attempt to set an extended attribute
touch mnt/f
xattr_name=user.foo
xattr_value=bar
setfattr -n $xattr_name -v $xattr_value mnt/f 2> err.log

# Check if the operation was not supported
if grep -q ""Operation not supported"" err.log; then
    echo ""Test passed: Operation not supported""
else
    echo ""Test failed: Expected 'Operation not supported'""
fi

# Clean up
umount mnt
rm -rf blob mnt err.log
```

Running this script should reproduce the behavior described in the bug report."
496142,"In the latest coreutils it attempts to preserve xattrs, and it can lead to very noisy output if the target filesystem does not support xattrs (or, perhaps, does not support selinux xattrs):

This would happen when copying to a filesystem that does not support selinux, or does not support xattrs - fat, cifs, nfs, mounts with selinux contexts ...

mv /home/myphotos /mnt/vfat-usbstick for example would probably trigger this.

I'm not sure it's worth issuing a warning for every file if the target doesn't support the thing mv is trying to preserve.  For that matter maybe mv should stop trying after the first EOPNOTSUPP?

The first time it happened to one of the admins I support I didn't think anything of it.  The second time it happened it made me think there was something to the problem.  There has already been some precedence that user actions that are accidentally dangerous are worth addressing (CTRL+ALT+BKSPACE), and this one has a higher potential damage rate than that.  To be quite honest I can't say that I've never accidentally done this, because there have been times over the years when I've turned up with odd zero'd out files and couldn't explain them.  And if you've never accidentally pasted your clipboard into a shell then you are a better user than most people I know.  Thanks :)


Description of problem:
If you accidentally copy+paste the output of 'ls -l' that has symlinks displayed into a linux terminal (right click in putty, center click in a linux terminal) you will accidentally zero our the target of the symlink.

The putty usage is the most likely to occur on accident. We've had multiple sys admins blow away cooked database files this way.

specifically the output of ls, on pretty much all versions.

How reproducible:
very

Steps to Reproduce:
1: create a file you don't care about
  dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/file
2: create a symlink to that file in current dir
  ln -s /path/to/file
3: Run 'ls -l /path/to/file' to see file size
4: Run 'ls -l'
5: Select output of 'ls -l' and paste into same terminal.
6: Run 'ls -l /path/to/file' to see file size

Actual results:
File will now have a 0 size

Expected results:

Discussion from RH Issue Tracker:

RH - 1. After running several tests we have come to the conclusion that the redirect character '>' would cause this to happen with any shell. Therefore this cannot be considered a bug.
2. To help ensure that US Courts does not damage any files if an user happens
  to paste the contents of a directory into the terminal, you could try the
  following suggestion:

Shells tcsh, bash, and apparently even ksh all have a ""noclobber"" feature, specifically designed to help protect users from inadvertently erasing/truncating existing files with an accidental use of some types of output redirection.

If US Courts would like to have some kind of protection in place, we could add  ""set -o noclobber"" in /etc/bashrc (assuming the users use bash).  If the users prefer tcsh for a shell, similar protection can be added to /etc/csh.cshrc.  (see the tcsh man page for details if needed).


Me - It does not surprise me that this would be a problem across all shells, as the `ls -l` isn't really shell dependent, nor is the >.  I see how the nocobbler would provide this protection, but at the determent of the many scripts common for administering a system.  Regardless, my point was that the output of 'ls' is buggy, not the behavior of the shells. 

RH - Please expand on the erroneous behavior found within the ls command. 

Me - The erroneous behavior of the ls command is to use a potentially destructive character (>).  A different character that provides the same visual representation, but a non-destructive behavior when copy-pasted, would be an ideal solution. Discussion w/ TAM mentioned a UTF8 character that looked like a >.  One problem I could see with this (and I don't know how often it would be true) is if people write scripts that parse 'ls -l' would have a harder time parsing a non-keyboard character.  They could, I just imagine it would be more difficult.  I don't know how much of an impact that would be.

RH - We have discussed this issue internally with engineering.  It is unlikely
   this would be accepted as a feature request by Product Management.   
  * Copying and pasting characters into the terminal and then pressing enter would likely be viewed as user error by the upstream community.  
  * Options for protection were suggested [using noclobber]
  * During phone conversation user suggested opening a bugzilla on the customer side to present this upstream.  This would be entered in the Fedora section of bugzilla.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=Fedora

At this time a feature request has been nacked.  

Normally I would suggest a Knowledge Base article. Red Hat can post an article to help users avoid file damage by using noclobber protection etc.

If the bugzilla in Fedora is accepted, we can then push for a Red Hat Enterprise Linux bugzilla to link to this ticket.","To reproduce the issue described in the bug report, you need to simulate the scenario where someone copies and pastes an `ls -l` output line into their terminal shell, inadvertently causing a file truncation due to the presence of the '>' character.

### Test Case Steps:

1. **Create Sample Files:**
   First, create some sample files that will be listed by `ls -l`.
   
   ```bash
   mkdir testdir
   cd testdir
   touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
   ```

2. **List Files with Detailed Information:**
   Use the `ls -l` command to list the files in detail.
   
   ```bash
   ls -l
   ```
   
   The output should look something like this:
   ```
   total 0
   -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 0 Nov  3 16:29 file1.txt
   -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 0 Nov  3 16:29 file2.txt
   -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 0 Nov  3 16:29 file3.txt
   ```

3. **Simulate Copy-Pasting with Output Redirection:**
   Suppose a user copies the line for `file1.txt` and accidentally pastes it into their terminal, including the '>' character:
   
   ```bash
   -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 0 Nov  3 16:29 file1.txt > file2.txt
   ```

4. **Check the Contents of `file2.txt`:**
   After executing the above command, check the contents and size of `file2.txt` to see if it was truncated or damaged.
   
   ```bash
   cat file2.txt
   ls -l file2.txt
   ```
   
   The expected result is that `file2.txt` has been truncated to 0 bytes.

### Expected Outcome:
- `file2.txt` should be empty (size 0) after the command execution, indicating that its contents have been overwritten or truncated due to the `>` redirection operator being copied and pasted with the `ls -l` output.

### Additional Notes:
- This issue is not specific to any particular shell. It can occur in `bash`, `tcsh`, `ksh`, etc.
- The problem arises when a user inadvertently copies and pastes an `ls -l` line, including the '>' character, into their terminal command prompt.
- Using `set -o noclobber` can prevent this issue but may impact scripts that rely on redirection.

### Conclusion:
This test case simulates the conditions under which the described bug occurs. It highlights the need for a non-destructive representation of redirection operators in the output of commands like `ls -l`."

...now doing an strace shows lots of these calls between the write()s:

capget(0x20071026, 0, NULL)             = -1 EFAULT (Bad address)
getxattr(""20020513h.gif"", ""security.capability""..., 0x7fff4e8701e0, 20) = -1 ENODATA (No data available)

...generally being 4 sets of calls (matching the 4 rows of output for each line), and this can be so slow that you can watch the terminal scroll each line upwards ... of course that's for the ""first"" attempt, if you then try it immediately afterwards it's fast (presumably the capabilities for each inode is cached). Also even from a cold cache POV, it's not always slow.

 As I said I'm not 100% sure this is an ls bug, and not a kernel bug or an ext3 ""capabilities are slow"" feature ... it's just I've only just starting seeing it since the coreutils update, so I thought I'd mention it.

When using any RH based Linux system (the problem has appeared in RH3 and 4 and now Fedora 9) with NFS mounts (mounted via the use of a SunOS NIS master server), any directory listing of the root directory, where the soft links to the /newhome directory are, produces a very long delay (of the order of 5 minutes at least) if the mount points are not found.  This is not usually a problem because we can remove the offending links if they are not needed (usually because a machine has 'died').  However, we have just installed a laptop and the laptop needs to have soft links in the root directory to NFS mounts on the rest of the network.  This causes a hang when doing an ls on the root directory.

Description of problem:
On line 21 in /etc/profile.d/colorls.sh, there's a test that reads like that:
      [ ""`tput colors 2>/dev/null`"" == ""256"" ] && \

I use zsh as my shell and zsh doesn't use the double = test as demonstrated in this example:
mchouque - /etc/profile.d %[ a == b ] && echo true
zsh: = not found
mchouque - /etc/profile.d %[[ a == b ]] && echo true   

Ie in the man page, it says [ is like the system version of test which clearly doesn't support == to compare two strings (zsh will only support it if you use the [[ compound command).

So I guess the test should be changed to
      [ ""`tput colors 2>/dev/null`"" = ""256"" ] && \

Comments?

Mathieu

438076,"In shell programming, if one needs to replace a file atomically (such that there
is no point at which the file doesn't exist), but keep a backup of the old file,
this is the standard construct to use:

# Create example files.
$ echo foo >foo
$ echo bar >bar

# Replace the contents of ""foo"" with the contents of ""bar"", atomically.
$ rm -f foo.backup   # remove old backup file, if present
$ ln foo foo.backup  # link() is atomic
$ mv bar foo         # mv uses rename(), which is atomic

The reason why this construct works is because mv uses rename() to move files
that lie on the same filesystem, and rename() is guaranteed to atomically
replace the target file, without affecting any other hard links to the file.

However, since at least coreutils-6.9-16.fc8, the mv command will first unlink
the target if the target has multiple hard links.  Here's strace output from the
mv command above:

$ strace mv bar foo
stat(""foo"", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600, st_size=4, ...}) = 0
lstat(""bar"", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600, st_size=4, ...}) = 0
lstat(""foo"", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600, st_size=4, ...}) = 0
stat(""foo"", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600, st_size=4, ...}) = 0
geteuid()                               = 4524
getegid()                               = 4524
getuid()                                = 4524
getgid()                                = 4524
access(""foo"", W_OK)                     = 0
unlink(""foo"")                           = 0
rename(""bar"", ""foo"")                    = 0

By first unlinking the target file, the mv command has created a race condition
where a process attempting to access ""foo"" could find it missing, thereby
defeating the guaranteed atomicity of rename().

Simply put: the mv command MUST NOT do this!

Although the coreutils mv command does contain a --backup option, this isn't an
acceptable work-around for three reasons.  First, the --backup behavior isn't
atomic, either:

$ echo foo >foo
$ echo bar >bar
$ strace mv --backup bar foo
[...]
rename(""foo"", ""foo~"")                   = 0
rename(""bar"", ""foo"")                    = 0

To be atomic, the first rename must instead be:

link(""foo"", ""foo~"")                     = 0

Second, even --backup worked, portable shell code can't assume that the version
of ""mv"" available supports it.  It's far simpler to use ln/mv in all cases than
to specifically test for --backup support and use it only if it's present.

And third, there's a huge installed base of shell scripts that already rely on
the ln/mv construct to be atomic.  It is unacceptable for mv to break this
assumption.

The culprit is this code in copy_internal() in src/copy.c (around line 1343):

else if (! S_ISDIR (dst_sb.st_mode)
         && (x->unlink_dest_before_opening
             || (x->preserve_links && 1 < dst_sb.st_nlink)
             || (!x->move_mode
                 && x->dereference == DEREF_NEVER
                 && S_ISLNK (src_sb.st_mode))
             ))
  {
    if (unlink (dst_name) != 0 && errno != ENOENT)
      {
        error (0, errno, _(""cannot remove %s""), quote (dst_name));
        return false;
      }
    new_dst = true;
    if (x->verbose)
      printf (_(""removed %s\n""), quote (dst_name));
  }

Specifically, the (x->preserve_links && 1 < dst_sb.st_nlink) test is what
triggers the unlink.  Removing that test should prevent the unlink() from being
called, but I'm not certain if that would break the assumptions of other
functions that might call copy_internal().  (For a simple utility, mv's logic is
deceptively complex; I'm not sure I've completely understood all of the link
handling.)

But regardless, however it's implemented in the code, mv MUST NOT first unlink
the target of a simple file-to-file rename(), regardless of whether the target
has multiple hard links.","```bash

preserved.  See the ""Renaming or Replacing Existing Packages"" section of

  Obsoletes: mktemp < 3:1.5-26

The last version of the mktemp package in rawhide was 3:1.5-25, so obsolete
everything less than 3:1.5-26 and provide something slightly larger than that.

Apparently sort ignores the comma inside the number values (though in the en_US
locale it probably should only be used as _thousands_ separator, so 2101,4
should not be a valid number in English).

Also sort does not handle the ""-t,"" separator argument correctly, because it
seems the value after the comma is still being included in the sorting key.","```bash

Description of problem:

When using du against a directory target that contains, whithin its tree,
non-accessible directories, du will not report the size of these. Since stat can
get the size, du should do it as well. Moreover, in the code it seems that this
was the intention, but a code bug has prevented this tool to report the size of
these directories:

                        if (ISSET(FTS_STOP))
                                return (NULL);
                        /* If fts_build's call to fts_safe_changedir failed
                           because it was not able to fchdir into a
                           subdirectory, tell the caller.  */

 			   because it was not able to fchdir into a
 			   subdirectory, tell the caller.  */

+			    		p->fts_info = FTS_ERR;
 			/* FIXME: see if this should be in an else block */
 			LEAVE_DIR (sp, p, ""2"");
 			return (p);
--

fts_build will return NULL on problems, and if it couldn't opendir() a directory
it will set the flag fts_info to FTS_DNR which is an unreadable directory.
So not checking if we just reset the flag and avoid counting the size of that
directory, however, if we remember it, we can then stat and count its size.

I noticed that tail does not react as snappy to changes in a file it
monitors (using 'tail -f') as is technically possible. So I did an
strace on it and found the following

nanosleep({1, 0}, NULL)                 = 0

...
as you can see it sleeps for a second between each check. Causing a
delay of maximum 1 second before a change in the file monitored is
reflected in the output of tail. Furthermore: it is not efficient to use
fstat to see what has changed to the file. I propose a change to tail
that either uses directly the inotify kernel-interface or via de sgi
FAM-daemon. I once already implemented this using the older dnotify
interface.

The command ""cp -Z root:object_r:tmp_t file-a file-b"" does not set the context

correctly.

This is because the ""-Z"" option of cp sets the default context for new files 
that are created.  If a file exists then cp does not unlink and recreate it, 
but instead just truncates it.

One potential solution would be to unlink and recreate the file.  My solution 
has been to apply the create context when truncating the file (patch 
attached).  If you don't like my patch then let me know what you would like

some shell scripts on a strict or MLS system and may also occur with the

Not really sure what is best here, but figured an open discussion would be good.
 It looks like mv preserves selinux contexts now, which is good for the most
part.  The issue I'm running into is users moving files from an nfs mount (which
has context nfs_t) into their local directories.  These directories are backed
up by amanda, but amanda doesn't not have permission for nfs_t (a good thing by
default), so these files don't get backed up.  I would guess that some kind of
exclusion list in mv would be unmaintainable.  Perhaps the best fix is for the
nfs mounts to show the contexts on the source system?  Will this ever happen?

Actual Results:  step 3 produces:

step 4 produces:

Expected Results:  The same result in both cases.


Additional info:

The reason that this bug isn't always very visible is due to the happy coincidence that ascii digits, and the decimal point, are in same lexical order as their numerical values.

In the above example the intention is to sort on the entire 2nd numerical field.  Of course the ""4a"" isn't a proper number, but this has been chosen so that the bug becomes more easily discerned.

What is actually happening is that in case 4) the values ""47"" and ""4a"" get numerically compared as expected. However in case 3) the values "" 4"" and "" 4"" get compared, and subsequent non-numerical comparison of ""7..."" and ""a..."" is performed. This is because without the -t option the separator is included in the field (!!).  If the ""a"" was a digit then it would, through the aforementioned happy coincidence, appear to sort correctly.

The reason for this very dire behavior is because if ""-t"" is used to specify the field separator then the separator is excluded from the field (which seems very sensible indeed).  But if -t isn't used then the default field separator (space) is included in the field (!&*@$%#).  It is considered to be character #1.  Goodness knows what happens if there are multiple spaces.

Now how, one might wonder, could a ""separator"" be a separator but not actually be a ""separator"" - both at the same time.  It is abject nonsense to include a separator in a field because then it isn't a separator because it is also considered a part of a field.

If one has distinct fields and separators then they should be ... distinct.","```bash

Now how, one might wonder, could a ""separator"" be a separator but not actually be a ""separator"" - both at the same time.  It is abject nonsense to include a separator in a field because then it isn't a separator because it is also considered a part of a field.

If one has distinct fields and separators then they should be ... distinct.","```bash
echo ""x 4a 2"" > testfile
echo ""x 47 1"" >> testfile
sort -k 2.1,2.2n testfile
sort -t' ' -k 2.1,2.2n testfile

This is the first time I have ever see the above option report...

EG: from the FC5 manual...
   If the first character of N (the number of bytes or lines)  is  a  â+â,
       print  beginning  with the Nth item from the start of each file

Assume a ""mv a b/"" where a is a directory and b does not exist. Every UNIX I

According to rcoker's descruption:

""runuser was designed to not call any PAM functions, so it is working
according to design in this regard (it's pam_limits.so which interprets
the limits.conf file).

You make a good case for a change to runuser in this regard.  There are
three options IMHO.  One option is to use pam for all operations
(runuser running as root will meet the criteria of pam_rootok.so so
nothing will be prevented), NB if we do this then we will not be calling
pam_selinux.so.  Another option is to just hard-code a call to
pam_limits.so which will do what you want.  A third option is to use pam
for the session option but not for auth etc (which may not be much
different to the first option in practice).

coreutils-5.93-1's tail no longer responds to the +N argument correctly,

In every version of tail I have ever used, on Linux / Solaris / Unix,
'tail +N' means 'cat the file from the Nth line' .

This is most annoying, and will break many scripts that use the '+N' feature -

        return PAM_SUCCESS;
 }
 int pam_close_session(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags){

Rationale:
There are still a lot of scripts that assume they can use ""su"" to switch
uids. In some situations (eg mine :) it is simply too much work to audit
them all and keep up with updates. Instead I intend to ""mv su su2; ln
runuser su"" and teach the other admins to use su2 instead (users are not
allowed to use su anyway). The only problem currently is that if the
permissions on the new su are accidently set to the usual values (by
admin error or a permission check script) there is a security hole
immediately. This small patch prevents this problem; it should not
interfere with normal operation in any way.

PS: This patch has been in use since a few weeks and has not caused any problems so far. It was posted to the SELinux-ML and acked by Russell Coker, who requested that the patch be bugzilla'd.

Terminal emulators for X set the $WINDOWID environment variable. According to the documentation su - (or su -l or su --login) unsets all environment variables except few variables like TERM, HOME or SHELL. The WINDOWID is similar to the TERM, it is a property of the window the terminal emulator is running in and does not change when su switches to another user ID. That's why it should be added to the list of preserved variables.

The md5sum utility generates incorrect MD5 checksums. For instance:

$ echo ""abc"" | md5sum
0bee89b07a248e27c83fc3d5951213c1  -

This value is inconsistent with both the RFC 1321 test suite (RFC 1321 pg. 21) and the output produced by the OpenSSL library, both of which generate a digest value of:

900150983cd24fb0d6963f7d28e17f72

Downloading the tarball from GNU and exploring the source, the computation is done in lib/md5.c. In the current version (5.2.1), the output of md5_buffer() function is correct (matching the RFC), while the output of md5_stream(), the function called by the md5sum utility, is not.

I thought I would post this here while I try to find the problem in the source. It seems surprising that this hasn't been reported.

Description of problem:
This has been repeated 3 times on 3 different servers, 2 FC2, one Advanced Server:  After creating a new database with Progress DB 9.1D09,  SOMETHING as yet unknown is hozed regarding the root user.   The behavior is that ALL binaries in the coreutils package will ""Segmentation Fault"".  Even BASENAME will segfault before it gets to the ""Usage:...."" display.   
<P>
Other users can login, and do normal tasks.   However, any attempt by other users to su will fail.  And if the system reboots, since MV, RM, and practically every 
other util used during startup segfaults, that box ain't coming up no more. 
<p>
Prior times when we reboot, it is possible to come up on a boot/rescue CD, but as soon as you chroot to the disk drive, everything starts get faulting again. 
<p>
Since BASENAME is the simplest program that fails, I had hoped to get the sources and recompile it with some printfs to see where in its initialization it is crapping out.  However, after loading the 5.2.1 sources, attempts to ""make basename"" fail because ""localedir.h"" is not found, and I cannot seem to figure out where that lives to get the correct package. 
<p>
Fortunately, this is on a test system, so until we lose power I can experiment.

153132,"find has a %f, which is the filename, and %h which is like basename, but it
would be nice if you could specify more control

For instance, for /home/user/foo.txt, I might want to show any of the following:
home/user/foo.txt
user/foo.txt
foo.txt

I might want to specify the number of leading parts to strip, or specify a
string to strip.

I suggest a new formatting flag %m.nb where m specifies the number of leading
parts to strip, and n specifies the number of end parts to strip

I also suggest a new formatting flag %B(regexp, regexp, ...) that says to remove
any occurence of regexp

I also suggest a new formatting flag %m.nr that prints the pathname relative to
current directory (like pwd), along with %R(regexp, regexp, ...)

%RR and %BB would be like %R and %B respectively except they would only keep the
specified regular expressions

ls has no way to individually specify columns, yet it attempts to do so with
various parameters like -gG, etc, but doesn't go all the way. The only
alternative is find through the clunky --printf statement.

I suggest a --columns= parameter with a comma deliminated list of the columns
you want, including size, blocks, time, name, basename, user, group, etc.",None
153120,"Description of problem:

I would like to propose and additional parameter for ls that would give a lot
more control. The parameter would be --printf (like in printf find) or something
like that, and would let you specify what columns you want to see.

There are issues with the parameters for ls. The main issue is that you cannot
properly individually specify which columns of ls -l you need, which means you
have to use some regexp magic with a stream editor, which is not very efficient
and hard to remember how to do. It's also not good for people migrating from
other platforms. There are a huge mess of hard-to-remember modifiers

To give an example of the mess:
ls -l shows:
drwxr-xr-x  22 root root     4096 Apr  1 02:23 var

To remove the user name, ls -g:
drwxr-xr-x  22 root     4096 Apr  1 02:23 var

To remove both user and group ls -gG
drwxr-xr-x  22     4096 Apr  1 02:23 var

Big issues:
1) We can't (afaik) remove time from the -l listing.
2) We can't (afaik) individually show file size, since the -s parameter shows
disk space usage and doesn't even match the file size which is shown in -l (if
you use --block-size=1)
3) We have to use the find `pwd` in order to show the full file path, because ls
doesn't allow you to show bare output with full pathnames. Instead, it prints
the directory name, then the files that are contained.

First of all, we need a replacement for -s that shows the actual size of file,
not disk space used. Perhaps --actualsize, and we need a parameter to remove any
field from -l (or better yet, specify fields)

But we need also a parameter to give us more control on placement...

I suggest we have a --printf parameter that you use formatting characters, such
as (but not necessarily) %%%f to show the filename only, %%%[n.m]b to show the
full path of the file, %%%[n.m]c to show the files' path relative to the current
directory. n and m would be optional and would tell how many portions of the
path to remove from the beginning and end of the output (0 for either does
nothing) %%%t for time, %%%u for user, %%%s for actual size, and %%%y for number
of blocks used on disk (like -s), etc... It'd look like:
user@server ~ ls --printf ""%%%c %%%1.c %%%2.b %%%1.b %%%b %%%.1b %%%f %%%s fdsa
fdsa %%%u"" \ blah/foo.txt

./blah/foo.txt blah/foo.txt user/blah/foo.txt home/user/foo.txt
/home/user/foo.txt /home/user foo.txt 543 fdsa fdsa user

I chose %%% simply because it wouldn't confuse people over other definitions for
printf",None
153109,"Description of problem:

When you type ls -- help, it shows the following:
""  -s, --size                 print size of each file, in blocks""

Instead it should show:
""  -s, --size                 print disk space used by file on file system, in
blocks""

""ls -s"" doesn't show the actual size of the file, but the number of blocks taken
up on disk. Therefore, it's expected if a block is 4K and the file is 1K, then
it will return 4K (if you use the -h option). 

The issue is that if you use the --block-size parameter, it shows (disk space
used)/(block size specified), not (file size)/(block size specified), which is
what we'd assume based on the description.

Currently, dircolors set up LS_COLOR for Gnu screen from
/etc/DIR_COLORS which is fine, but it's inconsistent with xterm,
gnome-terminal and konsole which use DIR_COLORS.xterm (since
$TERM=xterm for these). DIR_COLORS and DIR_COLORS.xterm differ in that
DIR_COLORS uses bold for coloured entries, which looks fairly horrible
(IMO of course). Anyway, there's no reason for screen to not have the
same settings as xterm and friends, so fixes would be to symlink
DIR_COLORS.xterm to DIR_COLORS.screen and add the lines 
TERM screen
TERM screen.linux
to DIR_COLORS.xterm

Or in fact, why bother with a separate .xterm file ? Anyway, would be
nice to have things consistent.

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fire up an xterm and run ls
2. screen
3. repeat (1), colours are now bold.
    

Actual Results:  LS_COLORS different for $TERM=xterm and $TERM=screen

Expected Results:  LS_COLORS could/should be the same for $TERM=xterm
and $TERM=screen

ls -l in Simplified Chinese locale, gives previous year's datestamp
hyphenated YYYY-MM-DD, and it gives current year's datestamp as Month
name DD HH:MM and also it doesn't justify both formats to same width
for a cleaner output, like in the English locale. The datestamp should
be same width for both current and previous years' dates to make it
nicer for the eyes, and use the Chinese characters for year month and
day after each of the numerals, YYYY MM DD. Spacing is not necessary
between YYYYMMDD since Chinese doesn't use space to delineate words,
other than to line up the columns.

I have a vfat mount with the following fstab:

/dev/hdb5 /mnt/share vfat users, umask=000,iocharset=iso8859-1, codepage=850        0 0

I'm running as root in a shell console. I'm trying to move a file from my home to the vfat share folder.

[root@paranoid ~]# ls /mnt/share/folder/
[root@paranoid ~]# mv file.txt /mnt/share/folder/
mv: cannot create regular file `/mnt/share/folder/file.txt': Permission denied
[root@paranoid ~]# ls /mnt/share/folder/
[root@paranoid ~]#

Now, if I do a simple 'cp' instead of an 'mv' I get:

[root@paranoid ~]# cp file.txt /mnt/share/folder/
[root@paranoid ~]# ls /mnt/share/folder/
file.txt

It's  even worst, If the file is already in the destination folder (after this copy) because it removes the destination file:

[root@paranoid ~]# mv file.txt /mnt/share/folder/
mv: overwrite `/mnt/share/folder/file.txt'? y
mv: cannot create regular file `/mnt/share/folder/file.txt': Permission denied
[root@paranoid ~]# ls /mnt/share/folder/
[root@paranoid ~]#

As you can see, it's  perfectly possible to delete and to copy the file in each end.

[root@paranoid ~]# cp file.txt /mnt/share/folder/
[root@paranoid ~]# rm /mnt/share/folder/file.txt
rm: remove regular file `/mnt/share/folder/file.txt'? y
[root@paranoid ~]# rm file.txt
rm: remove regular file `file.txt'? y
[root@paranoid ~]#

I tried to do it the other way arround, from vfat to ext3 and it has another strange behaviour related with security context:

[root@paranoid ~]# echo ola > /mnt/share/folder/file.txt
[root@paranoid ~]# cp /mnt/share/folder/file.txt .
[root@paranoid ~]# mv /mnt/share/folder/file.txt .
mv: overwrite `./file.txt'? y

Description of problem:
If I try to write a shell script with ""tcsh -e"", it just doesn't work.
 The reason is because the file /etc/profile.d/colorls.csh contains
the line:

test -f ~/.dircolors

-- this sets the return code to be non-zero unless the file .dircolors
exists, and causes the shell to abort.

The workaround is:  erase the file /etc/profile.d/colorls.csh

The fix is to fix up this shell script so it doesn't rely on testing
the return code of the test command.

/etc/profile.d/colorls.sh has the following code:

eval `dircolors --sh ""$COLORS""`
[ -z ""$LS_COLORS"" ] && return

and this means that if $TERM does not show up in ""$COLORS"" as
""colorizable"" then, quite surprisingly, aliases 'll' and 'l.'
are not defined at all.  This happened when after recent updates
FC3t1 suddenly started to sport TERM=gnome.

The code really should be:

....
alias ll='ls -l' 2>/dev/null
alias l.='ls -d .*' 2>/dev/null
eval `dircolors --sh ""$COLORS""`
[ -z ""$LS_COLORS"" ] && return

The first time I su to root on a given day, /bin/su will consume 100%

su that day will perform normally, but the problem always returns the

Dear sirs:
 
I am running FSF ls version 5.2.1 on Fedora Core 2 (i.e. Linux 
distribution) -- it is the binary version of ls that was distributed 
with the Fedora Core 2 Linux distribution.  The --format=vertical 
option seems to me to be broken: it is documented to be the same as 
-C, but in addition to not producing the same output, it produces 
seemingly erroneous output (output shown below).
 
Thank you for your fine work,

Thanks for the report.
Would you please see if you can reproduce the problem
using ls built from these unmodified sources?

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-5.2.1.tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-5.2.1.tar.bz2

significant patches.

You are right, that fixed it.  I hadn't tried building it since 
Fedora's version number matched the latest from your source, and it 
seems unusual for an O/S distribution to make mods to such a 
""generic"" utility.  I guess I'll report it to Fedora.  Thanks again.

allow a user to set certain options to be passed to ls. However, the
script /etc/profile.d/colorls.sh, which reads the file
/etc/DIR_COLORS, does not make any use of the OPTIONS variable. Hence
any setting I place on the OPTIONS line is ignored.

Description of problem:
The su command, included in the coreutils package, does not interact
with pam_selinux correctly.  Su calls pam_open_session before forking
to create a user's shell.  Since pam_selinux is executed before
forking, the SELinux domain of both the user's shell and the parent su
process are modified.  The result of this is that any PAM modules that
are run by pam_close_session when the user logs out are executed with
the user's SELinux security context instead of su's (user_t vs.
user_su_t).

The catch-22 is that if pam_open_session is called by the child after
the fork then the parent's pam_close_session with have no knowlege
that there is an open session.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
coreutils-5.2.1-3

How reproducible:

Steps to Reproduce:
Use su to become another user and then log out.  Notice the security
context of any PAM modules are run by pam_close_session.  If
pam_selinux is removed from /etc/pam.d/su then the security contexts
of any PAM modules are run by pam_close_session are appropriate.
    

Expected Results:  When pam_close_session is called, modules should
execute with the same SELinux security context as the parent su
process.  This matches how the standard Unix uid is handled
(change_identity() is called after fork).

Description of problem:
When su is passed the -s flag to specify a shell, it will do nothing
but open that shell.   The documentation for su seems to indicate that
-s shell should just override using the shell from /etc/passwd.

The upshot of this problem is that you can't script the running
commands as a different user and override the shell.  This breaks the
--user option to daemon() in /etc/init.d/functions.

Description of problem:
su uses one hardcoded default path for root and one for other users. These
default paths are different from the default paths used by login. After running
""su -l <user>,"" I have a different path than I would have if I simply logged in
as <user>.

One problem with this is that the paths defined by su contain ""local""
directories after standard directories. For example,
""/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin..."" instead of
""/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin..."". These default paths
also interfere with path munging that may normally be done in /etc/profile or
other login shell configuration files. For example, /etc/profile as included
with RH9 will add /usr/local/sbin to the front of the path (if it isn't already
in the path). This addition will be made after /usr/sbin and /sbin have been
added and so /usr/local/sbin will occur before ""system"" sbin paths.

It seems that this behavior is actually defined in a patch that is included in
the core-utils (and sh-utils before su was split out of sh-utils) source rpm:
sh-utils-1.16-paths.patch (a patch from RH 4.2). Both su and login would
normally try to use _PATH_DEFPATH and _PATH_DEFPATH_ROOT in /usr/include,
although it seems that this has been abandoned.

su -l and login should probably use the same default paths. At the very least,
su -l should place ""local"" paths before system paths so that sysadmins can
""override"" system installed software and obtain the overridden version not only
through normal login channels but also through su -l.

  I submitted bug #10117 in March, 2000 concerning Redhat 6.1, and it seems 
nothing has changed with 9.0 (w/ default locale: en_US.utf8, or en_US.iso885915,

input the way it does:

Can someone use this space to explain to me and others w/ the same question why 
this sort order makes sense for any en_US locality, and why RedHat has allowed 
values to sort this badly for at least 3 years?  I suspect a good number of 
professionals blindly assume (as I did) that sort is dependable on a standard 
RedHat install.  Should this bug be filed somewhere else?

Description:

  Merge with fifo as input files always opens

Testbed:

 Well, the actual problem is merging very big files, usually when the result is
 not saved on the disk.

Expected:

 -- normal termination, no result.

Actual results:

Lateral effects

 -- can crash any program that use /tmp.

91886,"Description of problem:
""ls .."" shows different directory content than ""cd .. ; ls"" when the current
directory is a symlink, pointing to another directory. This will create
confusion for an average user who is not aware of the fact that the current
directory is a symlink.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
4.5.3-19


How reproducible:

Steps to Reproduce:

1. say I've a directory as
/path1/foo
& another directory as
/path2


2. making a new symlink to /path1/foo

$ cd /path2/
$ ln -s /path1/foo/ bar
$ cd bar
/path2/bar
$ 


3. now executing the command ""ls .."" shows the content of the parent of target
directory (content of /path1, & not of /path2)
$ ls ..
foo

while ""cd .."" will lead me to /path2 
$ cd ..
$ pwd
/path2
$ ls
bar
$ 


.... this seem to be an inconsistency, considering the situation where a user is
not aware of that 'bar' is actually a symlink, what he sees is a completely
different output from seemingly trivial commands.


Actual results:
""ls ..""  &  ""cd .. ; ls"" show different directory contents.

Expected results:
The contenst shown by ""ls .."" should be the content of the parent directory of
the symlink...

Sorting on the 1st and 3rd fields with:

Sorting same file with:

Specifing the separator (this should be necessary):
    sort -k1,1n k3,3n -t ' '
works correctly.

Specifying the buffer size with -S or setting temporary file area with  -T does
not solve the problem.

unsetting this for the default and

Description of problem:
the -L (--dereference) switch to 'ls' does not work properly.

when I enter: 
$ ls -Ld {some link}

I should NOT see the linkname but rather the filename that the link is pointing
to.  

If I want to obtain information about the file that the link is pointing to I
should be able to do:
$ ls -Lld {some link}
and see

which is where my link points.  

Instead I am seeing:
drwxr-xr-x   14 root     mysql        4096 Apr 22 00:00 /usr/local/mysql
which is showing info for the linked-file all except for its name which displays
as the name of the link. - this mixture does not appear to be correct.

The aliases set up in /etc/profile.d are all bogus. Aliases should be
used by the user to customize his environment, not forced on us at a
system level. I've been forced to use an ugly hack in my .cshrc to
unalias silly colored ls aliases, etc.

Also, the 'which' alias generated by which-2.csh is broken.


Steps to Reproduce:
1. where echo | head -1
2. which echo

The easiet fix would seem to be to just empty that directory.
